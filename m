Tagged SP does work, and it is actually a good idea (it avoids using the default tag 
for the stack). It would be quite easy for the kernel to tag the initial SP and the 
stack on execve(). For other stacks, it is up to userspace, as you say, and would be 
made easier by making it possible to choose how a mapping should be tagged by the 
kernel via a new mmap() flag. Some software that makes too many assumptions on the 
address of stack variables will be disturbed by a tagged SP, but this should be 
fairly rare.

In any case, I don't think this impacts this ABI proposal (beyond the fact that 
passing tagged pointers to the stack needs to be allowed).
