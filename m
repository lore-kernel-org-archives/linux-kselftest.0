It's clear that the vdso version is much faster, my point was that
I could not think of any use case that cared about it being fast.

If there is a good reason for it, I also don't mind adding a
clock_getres_time64() vdso version everywhere.

I actually never understood the point of symbol versioning
in the vdso. What does that gain us? Note that there are
no conflicting symbol names between the versions, and
that nothing enforces the kernel headers to match the
symbol version used when linking.
