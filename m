As I said on the other thread, I would strongly prefer an API that
behaves along the lines of David Drysdale's old patch
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1439458366-8223-2-git-send-email-drysdale at google.com/
: Forbid any use of "..". This would also be more straightforward to
implement safely. If that doesn't work for you, I would like it if you
could at least make that an option. I would like it if this API could
mitigate straightforward directory traversal bugs such as
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1583, where
a confused deputy attempts to access a path like
"/mnt/media_rw/../../data" while intending to access a directory under
"/mnt/media_rw".

AT_BENEATH has to imply AT_NO_PROCLINK, right? Especially with the
semantics you picked for AT_BENEATH. With the original O_BENEATH_ONLY
semantics, it might be okay to not imply AT_NO_PROCLINK...
