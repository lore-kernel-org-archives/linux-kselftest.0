OK. Thanks for the explanation.

So, the way I see things from a type checking perspective, is that
'being (potentially) tagged' is a new property of values, othogonal
the the concept of address space. Leaving the other address spaces
(__iomem, __percpu & __rcu) aside, it should be possible to have
__user & __kernel tagged pointers as well as tagged ulongs:
	__user __tagged *
	__kernel __tagged *
	ulong __tagged
in addition of the usuals:
	__user *
	__kernel *
	ulong
But some of them are banished or meaningless:
	__user *            (all __user pointers are potentially tagged)
	__kernel __tagged * (tags are only for user space)
	ulong __tagged      (pointers need to be untagged during conversion)
So, only the followings remain:
	__user __tagged *
	__kernel *
	ulong
and the property '__tagged' becomes equivalent to '__user'.
Thus '__tagged' can be implicit and this would have the advantage
of not needing to change any annotations.

Since the conversion '__user *' to '__kernel *' is already covered
by the default sparse warnings, only the conversion '__user' to
'ulong' need to be covered (and this is already covered by the new
option -Wcast-from-as) but that is only fine for detection. After
detection and auditing, several solution are possible:
1) simply add '__force' in the cast (this is very bad)
2) moving this '__force' inside a macro '__untag_ptr(x)' would already
   more acceptable but is fundamentaly the same as 1)
3) a weaker form of '__force', '__force_as', will do the trick nicely
   as long as __user is equated to __tagged (and could be useful on
   its own but could also hide real AS conversion problems).
4) a more specific solution would be to effectively add a new attribute,
   '__tagged', to define '__user' like:
	#define __user attribute((noderef,address_space(1),tagged))
   and have something like '__untag', a weaker form of __force meaning:
   "I know what I'm doing regarding conversion from 'tagged'". 

Neither 3) nor 4) should be much work but while I firmly think that
4) is the most correct solution, I'm not sure it's worth the added
complexity, certainly if KHWASAN is not meant to be upstreamed.

For the compat pointers, I'm less sure to understand the situation:
even if they can't be tagged, treating them as the other __user
pointers will still be OK (but I understand that it could be
interesting to be able to track them, it's just that it's independent
from the __tagged property).
