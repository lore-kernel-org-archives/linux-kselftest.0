CLONE_PIDFD eliminates the race at the source and let's us avoid two
syscalls for the sake of one. That'll obviously matter even more when we
enable CLONE_THREAD | CLONE_PIDFD.
pidfd_open() is really just a necessity for anyone who does non-parent
process management aka LMK or service managers.
I also would like to reserve the ability at some point (e.g. with cloneX
or sm) to be able to specify specific additional flags at process
creation time that modify pidfd behavior.

Sure, that's simpler. I'll rework and add your Reviewed-by.

Yeah, I can remove it.
