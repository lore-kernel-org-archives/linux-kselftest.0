Hi Catalin,

I've added annotations for the user pointer casts pointed by the new
sparse flag -Wcast-from-as as you asked. I've used __force casts
instead of adding specialized macros.

There are also non annotated casts for other pointer types (iomem,
rcu) which are detected with the new flag, should I annotate those as
well?

I'm not sure though what value would that bring though, as there are
~3000 various sparse warnings produced with the default flags anyway.

WDYT?

Thanks!
