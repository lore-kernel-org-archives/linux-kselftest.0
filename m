You _can_ preserve vCPUs today using KVM_{GET,SET}_REGS, they just won't
run in the background during the reboot. This series can save you from
dumping VM memory to disk if it is backed by guest_memfd.

It's a bit of both. This series of course doesn't support everything
that guest_memfd can. At the same time, I also keep being (pleasantly)
surprised at preservation being relatively simple. For example, the code
to preserve a shmem file (via memfd) is roughly 600 lines, a big chunk
of which is comments. The code of course has some limitations, but it is
good enough for use in production.

I think it is fine if you want to take these changes through the KVM
tree, but I would like live update maintainers to be listed as reviewers
at least.

For one, we care about ABI breakages and versioning. The serialized
state is a part of live update ABI and changes to it should be ACKed by
us. For another, how the file handlers interact with their dependencies
can affect the behaviour that VMMs observe. Those changes should also
pass by some live update eyes.

So I think we should have a separate entry for KVM LIVE UPDATE that
lists the live update maintainers (or perhaps only kexec@) as a
reviewer. The patches can still flow through KVM tree but we'd get a
chance to ACK/NACK them.

Of course this all can evolve later as we see fit but I think this is a
good starting point.
