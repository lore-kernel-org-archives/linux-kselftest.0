It looks like, there is a bit of misunderstanding each other:
Andrei was talking about the current RFC version, where we haven't
introduced offsets for clock realtime. While Thomas IIUC, is looking
how-to expand time namespace over realtime.

As CLOCK_REALTIME virtualization raises so many complex questions
like a different length of the second or list of realtime timers in ns we
haven't added any realization for it.

It seems like an initial introduction for timens can be expanded after to cover
realtime clocks too. While it may seem incomplete, it solves issues for
restoring/migration of real-world applications like nodejs, Oracle DB server
which fails after being restored if there is a leap in monotonic time.

While solving the mentioned issues, it doesn't bring overhead.
(well, Andy noted that cmp for zero-offsets on vdso can be optimized too,
which will be done in v1).

Thomas, thanks much for your input - now we know that we'll need to
introduce list for timers in namespace when we'll add realtime clocks.
Do you believe that CLOCK_MONOTONIC_SYNC would be an easier
concept than offsets per-namespace?

Thanks,
             Dmitry
