Well, I am not against the explicit dependency thing, it just looks odd 
to me that some save/restore have a dependency and it's counterpart does 
not. As well as the dependencies for both registers being different.

Awesome!

Yeah, that would automatize the feature dependency for register loading, 
but maybe code would not be that clear on how it works? I have questionable 
taste, though.

Thanks!
