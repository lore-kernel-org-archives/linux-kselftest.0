Kaitao,

I think the maintainability pain in the current verifier-side kfunc
handling is clear, I don't think anyone would argue that it's not a
problem. Your bpf_list_* work is a good demonstration of that. I agree
it can be improved.

That said, I don't think extending .BTF_ids and/or BTF is the right
way to solve it.

Defining a kfunc metadata in one place is a reasonable direction in
principle, I agree.

Where I disagree is the mechanism. The complexity does not disappear,
it just moves into .BTF_ids, new macros and resolve_btfids. The
primary consumer of this metadata is the verifier, and I think it is
better to keep that metadata in verifier-local C definitions instead
of encoding it into .BTF_ids. Adding more indirection to this will
only hurt maintainability IMO.

This is not an argument for the .BTF_ids extension. Removing
`special_kfunc_type` mirroring is useful, but that will be addressed
directly by the targeted cleanup already under discussion.

The repetition is real. But removing is_bpf_*() helpers is not
automatically a simplification if the same information is now encoded
indirectly through section layout or local const arrays.

The same metadata is being maintained somewhere else, with more
indirection than before. The complexity just moved around, and was not
reduced.

The scattered "btf_id == *" will remain as long as it is necessary for
the verifier to do certain checks or other work depending on the
kfunc. Whether it's an array lookup, helper call or anything else in
the condition, the condition must be there. Refactoring can't reduce
this complexity, without changes in the verifier control flow.

Again, I agree with the premise that verifier safety checks could
become more modular where possible. But I think we should first
separate two questions:

1. What kfunc properties should be declared centrally?
2. Where that declaration should live?

While I'd like to answer (1) with "all of them", I am not convinced
the answer to (2) is .BTF_ids or BTF. A better C side declarative
representation would give us most of the benefit here without making
the BTF tooling more complex.

Here is how I think we should move forward:

  1. Your bpf_list_* work is orthogonal to BTF_ID refactoring, so it's
  reasonable to first focus on landing it without changes to generic
  kfunc handling.

  2. I plan to send patches (soon) for resolve_btfids, and then for
  BTF_ID macrology to eliminate the enum + array pattern. You are
  welcome to join the discussion and review / test the patches.

  3. After all of the above lands, we can come back to the general
  BTF_ID / kfunc handling discussion. If you are interested in
  developing this further, I suggest to re-think the approach and come
  up with a "single kfunc metadata definition" that doesn't require
  significant changes in .BTF_ids section layout.

A slightly off-topic comment: the usage of `_impl` pattern for kfuncs
should be considered deprecated. Any new kfuncs that work with
verifier-supplied arguments should use KF_IMPLICIT_ARGS mechanism.  So
the `bpf_list_add_impl` in your seires should only have one version:
`bpf_list_add` marked with KF_IMPLICIT_ARGS flag.

Thanks,
Ihor
