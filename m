Non-argument.

Why create an entire new subsystem (KUnit) when you can add a header
file (and .c code as appropriate) that outputs the proper TAP formatted
results from kselftest kernel test modules?

There are already a multitude of in kernel test modules used by
kselftest.  It would be good if they all used a common TAP compliant
mechanism to report results.

More specious arguments.
