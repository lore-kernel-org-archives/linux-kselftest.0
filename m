We didn't find any proc files where boot or monotonic time is reported,
but we will double check this.

It is a good point. We will work on it.

Thomas, there is no rush at all. This functionality is critical for
CRUI, but we have enough time to solve it properly.

The only thing what I want is that this functionality continues moving
forward and will not be put in the back burner.

Dmitry and I are going to be there.
