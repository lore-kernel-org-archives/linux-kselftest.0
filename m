Yeah I looked through the history trying to figure out if the choice was
intentional but I couldn't find a clue.

But the wrong @vmcb12_rip also affects soft IRQ injection, which I know
is not relevant here, but is part of the reason I brought this up.

If the guest has NRIPS, we use @vmcb12_rip to figure out if we need to
reset next_rip after a VMRUN. If the guest does not have NRIPS, we put
it directly in next_rip.

Either way we could end up with a messed up next_rip, and that can mess
up the guest IIUC. Of course, all of that only happens if we migrate
with a pending soft IRQ which is probably unlikely, but could happen.

For the bus lock thing that's probably the right thing to do. It fixes
the usual nested VMRUN path and doesn't really make the
KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE path any worse (feel free to add a Reviewed-by from
me).

But I am wondering if we should also fix @vmcb12_rip in the
KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE path (separately), for the soft IRQ case as well.
