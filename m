I see a general consensus on how to fix the regression.  Linus patch
plus some tweaks.  I will get to work on that today.

For v5.15 I think all that needs to get fixed is what Linus fixed
and the force_sigsegv case.  That is my priority.



For v5.16-rc1+ the instances that became force_fatal_signal need
a careful review to figure out which semantics we want.


Having a clear distinction between which forced signals we can let the
debugger intercept and which ones we can not seems to be what needs to
be added.


Kyle thank you for your explanation of what breaks.  For future kernels
I do need to do some work in this area and I will copy on the patches
going forward.  In particular I strongly suspect that changing the
sigaction and blocked state of the signal for these synchronous signals
is the wrong thing to do, especially if the process is not killed.  I
want to find another solution that does not break things but that also
does not change the program state behind the programs back so things
work differently under the debugger.
