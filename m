That would be the most straightforward use-case, yes.

I'm not sure about that. I think it's writing it to disk and then
parsing it. But it also wranges it into a socket to forward to
containers or services.

Note that systemd has a pull request for the coredump socket up:

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/43330

This should kill the usermodehelper soon on kernels that support the
socket.

Thanks.
