The rule is thou shalt not break userspace.  Whether or not the breakage is the
result of an explicit ABI change is irrelevant.

No.

It's probably fine for Google and other large companies that tightly control their
kernels and use cases, and have the resources to juggle the resulting complexity,
e.g. have kernel engineers on staff to track feature and dependencies, coordinate
and plan kernel upgrades, etc.

It's not acceptable for upstream, where downstream consumers often run a distro
kernel, have much more varied use cases, and don't always have a horde of kernel
engineers on staff to help them thread the needle you describe above.  And if
supporting live update as a general feature for all users of the kernel isn't
being factored into design considerations, then that needs to change, otherwise
this is all dead in the water.

I also don't see the point.  Maintaining a rigid save/restore ABI is annoying,
but it's not _hard_ (or at least, not _that_ hard), especially if there's a set
of well-documented best known practices that subsystems can follow, e.g. so that
individual subsystems don't need to learn painful lessons first-hand.  I genuinely
believe that maintaining the version hell you describe above would be more costly
in the long run than simply committing to full backwards compatibility within a
given subsystem.  I can imagine that enumerating what subsystems' information is
in the payload will require a different scheme, but for a given subsystem, I don't
see any reason to aim for anything less than full backwards compatibility.
