Let's stay with the input event example for the moment: Here, we have a
character device, and a user calls read() to retrieve one or more records
of type 'struct input_event' using the evdev_read() function. The original
timestamp gets put there using this logic:

        ktime_t time;
        struct timespec64 ts;
        time = client->clk_type == EV_CLK_REAL ?
                        ktime_get_real() :
                        client->clk_type == EV_CLK_MONO ?
                                ktime_get() :
                                ktime_get_boottime();
        ts = ktime_to_timespec64(time);
        ev.input_event_sec = ts.tv_sec;
        ev.input_event_usec = ts.tv_nsec / NSEC_PER_USEC;

clk_type can get set using an ioctl() to real, monotonic or
boottime. We have to stop using EV_CLK_REAL in the
future because that breaks in y2038, but I guess EV_CLK_MONO
and EV_CLK_BOOK should stay.

If we want this to work correctly in a namespace that has a
user defined CLOCK_MONOTONIC timebase, one way to
do it might be to always call ktime_get() when we record
the timestamp in the kernel-internal CLOCK_MONOTONIC
base, but then convert it to the correct base when copying to
user space.

Note that AFAIU practically all users of evdev do /not/ actually
care about the time base, they only care about the elapsed
time between intervals, e.g. to track how fast a pointer should
move based on input from a trackpad. I don't see any reason
why one would compare this timestamp to a clock_gettime()
value, but of course at the moment this has well-defined
behavior that would break if we change clock_gettime(), and
we have a process in the namespace that opens
/dev/input/eventX and relies on meaningful timestamps
relative to a particular base.
