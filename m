Yes, of course.

I've done a lot of hacking on sparse and as such I run a lot of tests.
What I see with these tests is that a lot of annotations are wrong or
missing so I'm very reluctant to add another attribute. Even more so
one that would be only slightly different than an existing one. OTOH,
if it's something localized or a one-shot and there is a need, ...
why not?

What would you ideally need?
