Can it be on x86?

its not possible on ppc. the keys can *all* be  the-same-attributes-disable all the
time.

However you are right. Its conceivable that some arch could provide a
feature where it can be x-attribute-disable for key 'a' and
y-attribute-disable for key 'b'.  But than its a bit of a headache
for an application to consume such a feature.

Ben: I recall you requesting this feature.  Thoughts?

or do powerpc specific sysfs interface.
or a debugfs interface.
