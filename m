Isn't that an inherent limit with CMA as it is? If the area gets
fragmented, some buffers may no longer be allocated since there is no
remaining hole big enough to accommodate them? I do hear that putting
arbitrary limits would make this worse, which might breach the threshold
at which it becomes a problem.

Understood, that makes sense, and with the reclaim scenario mentioned

Thank you for the feedback. It looks like this won't work. It also
excludes the attempt through double charging dmem[1] as it would have
similar issues trying to use memcg.

From your last sentence, would this rather call for a different
controller entirely that would handle CMA semantics? Referencing the
other thread[2] it would also make the charging separate from the
allocator, but simplify making it opt-in at the user's implementation,
e.g, the dmabuf heap would call some cma_cgroup_try_charge() and
cma_cgroup_uncharge() around cma_alloc()/cma_release().
