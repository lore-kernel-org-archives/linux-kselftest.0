Right. That will break MADV_COLLAPSE, IIUC.

For MADV_COLLAPSE on anonymous shmem, eligibility is determined by the
TVA_FORCED_COLLAPSE path via shmem_allowable_huge_orders(), not by
whether the inode mapping got mapping_set_large_folios() at creation
time.

Using mmap(MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS):
- create time: shmem_enabled=never, hugepages-2048kB/shmem_enabled=never
- collapse time: shmem_enabled=never, hugepages-2048kB/shmem_enabled=always

With the !is_shmem guard, collapse succeeds. Without it, the same setup
fails with -EINVAL.

Lance
