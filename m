You said yourself that the test is comparing an in-kernel walk to
parsing strings and opening files.

Arguably one of the the cgroup_iter_memcg.c tests can be extended to
allocate some mem and check if the value is reflected in the stats.
But there is a line between MM tests and BPF tests.
All BPF kfuncs except iterator logic itself are thin wrappers on
top of the existing MM functionality. Hence, I don't think that
BPF selftests are a place to stress-test these things.

I don't think that it's responsibility of BPF selftests to check all
these fields.

This sounds like an MM stress test.

From BPF perspective the test is over-complicated.
There is no need for a generic tree construction.
Creating a hierarchy of several cgroups, allocating memory within
these cgroups and walking them would work perfectly fine.
Existing selftests already do that. Aside from querying actual memory
amount what else do you want to cover?

These are MM tests, not BPF tests.
