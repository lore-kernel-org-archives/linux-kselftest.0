Something I haven't seen in the discussion is that one of the ways I
have seen a non-libc clone used is to implement a fork with flags.
That is a new mm is created, and effectively a new process.  Which
makes the characterization different.

In general creating a thread with clone and bypassing libc is
incompatible with pthreads, and the caller gets to keep both pieces.

As long as there is enough information code can detect that
shadow stacks are in use, and the code is able to create their own
I don't see why it shouldn't be the callers responsibility.

On the other hand I don't see the maintainer of clone Christian Brauner
or the libc folks especially Florian cc'd on this thread.  So I really
don't think you have the right folks in on this conversation.
