Hi Mark,

This generally looks good, but I have a few thoughts below. The key
things are:

(1) I think the commit message could be clearer. I've provided some
    suggested wording below.

(2) There are a couple of trivial bits to change in the code, commented
    below.

(3) AFAICT there's a latent bug where ZCR_ELx[63:4] aren't always reset
    before returning to userspace when we have a return from idle. We
    get away with that because those bits haven't been allocated yet,
    but given that they're RES0, we should reset them to avoid
    unexpected behaviour once they are allocated a meaning in future.
    
    This patch happens to fix that, but for the sake of stable I think
    we should have a preparatory patch to reset ZCR_ELx when returning
    from idle. For example, rename sme_suspend_exit() to
    fpsimd_suspend_exit(), and add the appropriate logic there.

This description is hard to follow.

How about:

| arm64/fpsimd: Configure all ZCR/SMCR bits when loading task state
|
| Currently, when loading a task's SVE and/or SME state, we configure
| ZCR_ELx.LEN and/or SMCR_ELx.LEN with read-modify-write sequences,
| preserving all other bits of the registers (e.g. SMCR_ELx.{FA64,ZT0}).
| This relies on all the other bits already holding the expected value
| for the task.
|
| It would be simpler and more robust to configure all the bits without
| a read-modify-write sequence:
|
| * Doing so will remove the need to configure these registers during
|   feature detection and when returning from idle, simplifying the code
|   and removing some redundant writes to the registers.
|
| * Doing so will permit KVM to clobber other bits of the registers when
|   no task state is bound. Along with other changes (e.g. when saving
|   state), this will make it possible for KVM to expose a different
|   configuration to guests (e.g. disabling ZT0 for vCPUs, even if ZT0
|   is exposed to userspace).
|
| When SVE and/or SME is not exposed to userspace (and userspace access
| it prevented by CPACR_ELx.{ZEN,SMEN}), the values of ZCR_ELx and
| SMCR_ELx are immaterial, as all functionality affected by those
| registers will be trapped. Thus there is no need to reset those
| registers to ensure correct behaviour when SVE and/or SME is not used
| by a task.

I've deliberately avoided detail on how KVM saves or relaods state,
because there are a large number of interacting pieces there, and I
don't think it's material beyond "this change is a step towards allowing
KVM to expose a different configuration to vCPUs".

> Provide a helper task_smcr() which generates the value of SMCR_EL1 to

I think we can drop this part of the description.

Let's delete the comment.

The existing principle that we must restore the length before the data
also applies to ZCR_ELx (which has no similar comment), and the general
principle that KVM might clobber the register is common to all the
FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers.

What's the ISB for? That mysteriously appeared in v11 without
explanation. It wasn't in the original code, prior versions of the
series, or my suggested rework with the task_smcr() helper.

I don't believe it's necessary to add an ISB here.

Mark.
