Policy might have been the wrong word. I think this is a property of the
conversion process/request, not a property of the memory like how
shared/private is a property of the memory?

I'll have to find another word to describe this enum of

* KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES2_ZERO
* KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES2_PRESERVE

If pKVM's (kernel, or elsewhere) documentation says something like

  Shared to private (in addition to private to shared already specified
  in the userspace/KVM contract) conversions through guest_memfd
  specifying ZERO will have memory contents zeroed.

Would that then cover both perspectives? I see Fuad's point that pKVM
would like to provide guarantees in the shared to private direction too,
and I see Sean's point that the shared to private direction isn't a
userspace/KVM thing.

The awkward part is that we guarantee both directions for PRESERVE but
not for ZERO.

Omg, it is backwards!! Might have been copypasta...

How about:

or as an optimization to avoid having to re-zero memory when userspace
could have relied on the trusted entity to guarantee the memory will be
zeroed as part of the entire conversion process.

I started with some implementation and was questioning the value of a
CAP. It seems like there won't be anything dynamic about this?

The userspace code can check what platform it is running on, and then
decide ZERO or PRESERVE based on the platform:

If the VM is running on TDX, it would want to specify ZERO all the
time. If the VM were running on pKVM it would want to specify PRESERVE
if it wants to enable in-place sharing, and ZERO if it wants to zero the
memory.

If someday TDX supports PRESERVE, then there's room for discovery of
which algorithm to choose when running the guest. Perhaps that's when
the CAP should be introduced?

Do you mean ZERO is only guaranteed for private to shared? If we say
"ZERO is only guaranteed for private to shared", then pKVM could
additionally guarantee zeroing for shared to private. If we say it is
only supported for private to shared, then should I return -EOPNOTSUPP
and therefore not allow platforms to provide other guarantees?

I think we should stick to guarantees for this

* not specified (default) = no guarantees whatsoever
* ZERO = guaranteed zero for shared to private, no guarantees for
         private to shared. Platforms can add on more guarantees.
* PRESERVE = guaranteed preseved in both directions

-EOPNOTSUPP should probably be understood as "There is no way to
guarantee this" like how TDX would return -EOPNOTSUPP for PRESERVE
(now).

Thank you for this summary :)

I see you dropped any documentation to do with testing. I meant to
document it (at least something about the unspecified case) so it can be
relied on in selftests, with the understanding (already specified
elsewhere in Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst) that nothing about
KVM_X86_SW_PROTECTED_VM is to be relied on in production, and can be
changed anytime. What do you think?
