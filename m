Do you have some example unit tests somewhere? The docs are all neat, but
real example helps a lot with the tried&true art of copypasting :-)

I'd like to give this a test spin with some of the unit tests we already
have in drm. And especially figuring out how we could integrate this with
our existing infrastructure.
