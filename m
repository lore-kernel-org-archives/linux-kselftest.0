Ok, I see, VCPU exits to userspace due to MMIO, userspace calls
KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY, userspace resumes VCPU and uses fault_info from
KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY. Nicely spotted.

My point was that since there's no serialization between memslot changes and
KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY, the condition can become true immediately after the if
statement. Doesn't really matter though anyway.

I think there's a word missing there, I meant to say that it would be useful to
explain *why* the x86 implementation does not mark new PTEs as accessed, while
arm64 marks them as accessed, and arm64 also does that for existing PTEs.

Ah, I missed that, thanks for explaining!

I was wondering if you have any plans about posting an updated series.

Thanks,
Alex
