Let's take the per-cpu spinlock as an example to explain why we need
the "compare fail" and "cpu_id compare fail" to return different
values.

Getting this lock involves doing:

cpu = rseq_cpu_start();
ret = rseq_cmpeqv_storev(&lock->c[cpu].v, 0, 1, cpu);

Now based on the "ret" value:

if ret == 0, it means that @v was indeed 0, and that rseq
executed the commit (stored 1).

if ret > 0, it means the comparison of @v against 0 failed,
which means the lock was already held. We therefore need to
postpone and retry later. A "try_lock" operation would return
that the lock is currently busy.

if ret < 0, then we have either been aborted by the kernel,
or the comparison of @cpu against cpu_id failed. If we think
about it, having @cpu != cpu_id will happen if we are migrated
before we enter the rseq critical section, which is pretty
similar to being aborted by the kernel within the critical
section. So I don't see any reason for making the branch target
of the cpu_id comparison anything else than the abort_ip. In
that situation, the caller needs to either re-try with an
updated @cpu value (except for multi-part algorithms e.g.
reserve+commit, which don't allow changing the @cpu number on
commit), or use cpu_opv to perform the operation.

Note that another cause why the @cpu == cpu_id test may fail is
if rseq is not registered for the current thread. Again, just
branching to the abort_ip and letting the caller fallback to
cpu_opv solves this.

I'm not so sure returning kernel error codes is the expected
practice for user-space libraries.

Thoughts ?

Thanks!
