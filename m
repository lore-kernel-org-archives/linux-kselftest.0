Hi Andrey,

(sorry for the delay)

Not AFAICT.

If it makes things any simpler, we could revisit this though it seems to
me more consistent not to pass a tagged pointer back into the kernel
when the original one was untagged (i.e. mmap vs munmap).

(if it wasn't for pointers in structures, I would have just left the
problem entirely to the C library to do the untagging before calling the
kernel)

You are right, the pointer seems to have originated from the kernel as
already untagged (mmap() on the driver), so we would expect the user to
pass it back an untagged pointer.

Yes, it's similar to the devio one.

I'm less worried about (2) since, as you say, it's under the arch
control and, even if it changes slightly over time, we can be aware of
this.

I think these are the main cases.

Vincenzo F did some more in-depth analysis, I'll let him answer whether
he has found any more cases.

At a quick grep, arm64_notify_segfault() (it changes the siginfo
si_code). There are a few other places which assume that the address is
already untagged but we don't seem to have a clear guideline on the ABI.
For example, prctl(PR_SET_MM) takes user addresses and we assume they
are untagged (as in the mmap() and friends).

I added a similar test with an LD_PRELOAD'ed malloc/free implementation
on Debian and seemed alright but I'd rather want something more
consistent when defining the user ABI, otherwise we have places where
find_vma() is called but requires untagging.

I think point (1) is not too bad, usually found with grep.

As I've said in my previous reply, I kind of came to the same conclusion
that searching __user pointer casts to long may not actually scale. If
we could add an __untagged annotation to ulong where it matters (e.g.
find_vma()), we could identify a ulong (default tagged) and annotate
some of those.

However, this analysis on __user * casting was useful even if we don't
end up using it. If we come up with a clearer definition of the ABI
(which syscalls accept tagged pointers), we may conclude that the only
places where untagging matters are a few find_vma() calls in the arch
and mm code and can ignore the rest.

FTR, this code is a prerequisite for ARM's memory tagging hardware
feature. Interestingly, I can't find SPARC ADI support dealing with this
aspect at all. I suspect their user ABI does not allow tagged addresses
passed to the kernel.
