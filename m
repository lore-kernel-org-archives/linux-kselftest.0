I can't tell for sure whether such sparse option would be the full
solution but detecting explicit __user pointer casts to long is a good
starting point. So far this patchset pretty much relies on detecting
a syscall failure and trying to figure out why, patching the kernel. It
doesn't really scale.

As a side note, we have cases in the user-kernel ABI where the user
address type is "unsigned long": mmap() and friends. My feedback on an
early version of this patchset was to always require untagged pointers
coming from user space on such syscalls, so no need for explicit
untagging.
