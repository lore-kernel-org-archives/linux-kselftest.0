a bunch of compat
a bunch of ioctl that use ptr to stored ints

ipc/shm.c:1355
ipc/shm.c:1566

mm/process_vm_access.c:178:20
mm/process_vm_access.c:180:19
substraction => harmless

mm/process_vm_access.c:221:4
?

mm/memory.c:4679:14
should be __user pointer

fs/fuse/file.c:1256:9
?

kernel/kthread.c:73:9
?

mm/migrate.c:1586:10
mm/migrate.c:1660:24

lib/iov_iter.c
???

kernel/futex.c:502
uses user addr as key

kernel/futex.c:730
gup, fixed

lib/strncpy_from_user.c:110:13
fixed?

lib/strnlen_user.c:112
fixed?
