Hi Aleksa,

Thanks a lot for the detailed reply, it gives a lot of the background I was
missing. I really appreciate it, I have learned a lot as I wasn't aware of the
earlier work on this. Sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but I needed
a few days to absorb all the linked information.

Ah yes. If I am correct, it would block all the fXXX syscalls from doing
harm (at least w.r.t. read/write operations) because they use the fmode for
rights checking on the fd, and this cannot be changed without going through
an open() variant.

Hence the issue is the case when we pass a magic path to e.g. truncate()
as it does no upgrade restriction check right now on the struct file. So
we hade to do this for every relevant syscall. And the question is... where.

Yes, so (at the very least) we also want RESTRICT_LOOKUP for directory fds.

I went through Drysdale's implementation a bit. He links the capability check
to the translation of an fd to a struct file. I agree this is a bit invasive
(as he writes himself), and perhaps we can do better. Is this what you mean
by "far from ideal"?

I would really like to try; it is a very nice problem for me to tackle;
you need to gain experience somehow :)

I wonder how checking all this in generic_permission() would work. The
access to the fd that the procfs magic link provides is essentially an
issue of path traversal, and in generic_permission() you just have the
inode in question. Ah but of course, you can use the mode bits of the
magic link to encode the information, as you suggest. What downside did
you encounter using this idea?

One thing I can think of is that if we want more than rwx upgrade control
(more capsicum style control), this is not going to be sufficient. If you
want to restrict fchown on an fd, there is no way to encode this in the
magic link mode. Maybe we should determine first the minimum capability
support that we want to make the feature useful (and extendable)?

Not a version of the cap syscalls?

Ah, I wanted to have the upgradable options as white list, because with a
blacklist approach you have the issue that if there is ever a restriction
added that has overlap with an existing restriction, it would disable part
of a restriction you thought you had set. But maybe we just need to prevent
such a scenario, and I agree the whitelist option is even worse.

Btw, I just saw you gave a cool talk at FOSDEM this year, and I missed it,
even though I was there! Thanks for linking the cve-2019-5736, was really
interesting to read.

Thanks,
Jori.
