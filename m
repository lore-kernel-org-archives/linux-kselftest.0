Unless I'm misunderstanding something, I don't think there is
anything to change for this specific point. Sparse don't warn
(by default) on "cast from pointer with address space to integer",
as it always been the case, I think. I think it's the good choice.

It's just that recently, I've added a new flag -Wcast-from-as [1],
defaulting to 'no', specifically to *detect* these cast because of
these tagged pointers.

Note: I tend to think more and more that __force is simply too
      strong and weaker form, like __force_as and __force_bitwise
      would be more appropriate.
