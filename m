Please correct me if I'm wrong here (this is the first patch I've
written for VFS). Isn't the retry/LOOKUP_REVAL code meant to handle this
-- or does that only handle if a particular path component changes
*while* it's being walked through? Is it possible for a path walk to
succeed after a path component was unmounted (obviously you can't delete
a directory path component since you'd get -ENOTEMPTY)?

If this is an issue for AT_THIS_ROOT, I believe this might also be an
issue for AT_BENEATH since they are effectively both using the same
nd->root trick (so you could similarly trick AT_BENEATH to not error
out). So we'd need to figure out how to solve this problem in order for
AT_BENEATH to be safe.

Speaking naively, doesn't it make sense to invalidate the walk if a path
component was modified? Or is this something that would be far too
costly with little benefit? What if we do more aggressive nd->root
checks when resolving with AT_BENEATH or AT_THIS_ROOT (or if nd->root !=
current->mnt_ns->root)?

Regarding chroot attacks, I was aware of the trivial
chroot-open-chroot-fchdir attack but I was not aware that there was a
rename attack for chroot. Thanks for bringing this up!

Unless I'm missing something, would this not also affect using a
mountpoint as a dirfd-root (with MS_MOVE of an already-walked-through
path component) -- or does MS_MOVE cause a rewalk in a way that rename
does not?

I wouldn't mind tying AT_THIS_ROOT to only work on mountpoints (I
thought that bind-mounts would be an issue but you also get -EXDEV when
trying to rename across bind-mounts even if they are on the same
underlying filesystem). But AT_BENEATH might be a more bitter pill to
swallow. I'm not sure.

In the usecase of container runtimes, we wouldn't generally be doing
resolution of attacker-controlled paths but it still definitely doesn't
hurt to consider this part of the threat model -- to avoid foot-gunning
as you've said. (There also might be some nested-container cases where
you might want to do that.)

You're right about this -- for C runtimes. In Go we cannot do a raw
clone() or fork() (if you do it manually with RawSyscall you'll end with
broken runtime state). So you're forced to do fork+exec (which then
means that you can't use CLONE_FILES and must use SCM_RIGHTS). Same goes
for CLONE_VFORK.

(It should be noted that multi-threaded C runtimes have somewhat similar
issues -- AFAIK you can technically only use AS-Safe glibc functions
after a fork() but that's more of a theoretical concern here. If you
just use raw syscalls there isn't an issue.)

As for why use setns() rather than pivot_root(), there are cases where
you're operating on a container's image without a running container
(think image extraction or snapshotting tools). In those cases, you
would need to set up a dummy container process in order to setns() into
its namespaces. You are right that setns() would be a better option if
you want the truthful state of what mounts the container sees.

[I also don't like the idea of joining the user namespace of a malicious
container unless it's necessary but that's probably just needless
paranoia more than anything -- since you're not joining the pidns you
aren't trivially addressable by a malicious container.]

Unless I'm very much mistaken this was fixed by bfedb589252c ("mm: Add a
user_ns owner to mm_struct and fix ptrace permission checks"). If you
join a user namespace then processes within that user namespace won't
have ptrace_may_access() permissions because your mm is owned by an
ancestor user namespace -- only after exec() will you be traceable.

We still use PR_SET_DUMPABLE in runc but that's because we support older
kernels (and people don't use user namespaces under Docker) but with
user namespaces this should not be required anymore.
