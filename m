Thinking some more on this, we should probably keep the HWCAP_* bits for
actual hardware features. Maybe someone else has a better idea (the
linux-abi list?). An option would be to make use of AT_FLAGS auxv
(currently 0) in Linux. I've seen some MIPS patches in the past but
nothing upstream.

Yet another option would be for the user to probe on some innocuous
syscall currently returning -EFAULT on tagged pointer arguments but I
don't particularly like this.

In the way of being explicit about which syscalls support tagged
pointers, unless we find a good reason to support tagged pointers on all
syscalls and avoid any lists.
