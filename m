I don't think there is a way to fix this in /proc/pid/fd. At the proc
level, the /proc/pid/fd/N files are just soft symlinks that follow through to
the actual file. The open is actually done on that inode/file. I think
changing it the way being discussed here means changing the way symlinks work
in Linux.

I think the right way to fix this is at the memfd inode level. I am working
on a follow up patch on top of this patch, and will send that out in a few
days (along with the man page updates).

thanks!
