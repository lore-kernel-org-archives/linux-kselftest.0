Let's step back a bit. I don't think backwards compatibility in the
_ABI_ is all that important in live update's context. What is important
is that our users are able to live update from kernel version X to Y.
The line format the kernel uses to describe its state is an
implementation detail. Our users never see it.

The high level idea is that when you need to make a change to the ABI so
the kernel can better describe the objects/resources/files it is
passing, you create a new version of the ABI and allow transitions from
older versions.

Say you make some changes and need an ABI version v5. You don't get rid
of v4. You keep it around. LUO core will facilitate picking the right
version for the next kernel. So it will be possible to seamlessly
upgrade your kernel that speaks v4 to a new kernel that speaks v4 and
v5. Now this kernel can start speaking v5 if its successor speaks v5
too. And so on for going to v6 and v7, etc.

After a "reasonable" time given for upgrades, you deprecate v4. v4 has
been around long enough and our users have had a chance to go to kernels
speaking newer versions. That's when you remove the code for v4 from the
kernel.

We can argue what "reasonable" means, but the core idea stays. 

It will still be possible to go back to v4 or earlier, but you'd need an
extra stop along the way. And of course, vendors can keep a wider
support matrix downstream if they see the need for it.

Does this idea of "backwards compatibility" sound acceptable to you, at
least at a high level?

Now coming back to today's reality. We don't yet support this version
transition. I proposed the idea at LPC 2025 [0]. Logan Odell has taken
over the work since I have other things on my plate, but it is something
being actively developed. Logan recently sent some RFCs [1] for this
too, though TBH I haven't yet gotten to those patches. We also have
proposed a talk about this at LPC 2026, it would be great if you could
attend (if the talk gets accepted).

If you say that we should figure this version transition out and land it
upstream before we land the KVM code, I think that's a fair ask. I can
work with that.

But I think we first need to agree on the principles of the
compatibility model I described above.

The design of live update was discussed and agreed upon in the open.
David Rientjes (and now Pasha) has been hosting the live update
biweeklies [2] from the very start of the project. The series is open to
everyone and notes shared for those who couldn't join. This meeting was
attended by a lot of people from different companies and different
subsystem backgrounds.

There have also been a microconference at LPC 2025 where topics around
live update in PCI, MM, VFIO, IOMMU, etc. were discussed, along with
presentations at subsystem tracks in other conferences.

Of course, it is impossible to get all maintainers of all subsystems to
attend these sessions or conferences. That's fine.

But I think it is quite unfair to say that live update is developed in
private or in small groups.
