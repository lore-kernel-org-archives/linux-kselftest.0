The arguments I have heard from various people so far are:

(1) Userspace would be able to clone a random chroot to /woot and run a
    binary from it without having to set up a complicated sandbox
    effectively making dynamically linked binaries more like static
    binaries in a sense.

(2) Quote:
    "If you debootstrap/dnf a chroot to some location in your
    home dir and try to run a binary from it, that it tries to load the
    libraries from your /usr is a pretty unintuitive and not at all
    useful behavior."

(3) Quote:
    "[Various remote execution things run in locked down containers that
    disable userns, which makes the sandbox impossible and hence our
    builds wouldn't work there."

I'm discounting "Oh, userspace already allows this so why not the
kernel.". I think that's generally a bad argument. Kernel and userspace
aren't really alike in that regard.

The userspace ORIGIN concept is guarded behind AT_SECURE. The kernel has
to enforce the same rule. That means the loader now depends on the type
of binary. I think this is a rather serious issue.

First, it creates confusion in userspace what loader is used. Second, it
means anything that any build/chroot that uses AT_SECURE binaries now
has to use the sandboxing solution anyway or risk that some binaries use
the system loader and others the chroot loader.

Ignoring AT_SECURE, LSMs likely will need a say in whether that ORIGIN
thing gets honored or not introducing yet another vector where this can
be overriden or ignored.

Also, we change long-standing kernel behavior which will be very
surprising for any userspace that might implicitly rely on the fact that
the system loader is used. So even if we were to do something like this
it would very likely have to be configurable in some way.

This makes this all ripe for malicious loader injection attacks. And we
need to consider this possibility.

So I'm not enthusiastic about this. I want this to be consistent.
