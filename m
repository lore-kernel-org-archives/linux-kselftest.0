I was assuming non-existence of any 32bit powerpc
systems supporting memory keys. Sounds like it was a wrong assumption.

However, I think, the framework as it stands today should work. All
the functionality is captured in pkeys.c and pkeys.h which are generic
ppc files.  Its just a matter of providing the 32-bit implementation
for whichever sub-arch that support it.  Can you point me to problem
areas? I will fix them.

Thanks for you interest. Togather we should be able to make it
happen.

yes. This needs to happen parallely.
