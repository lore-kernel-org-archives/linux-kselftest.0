Mostly your comments on code-organization in the signal handler. There
are still some #if defined(__i386__)  ..... Can be cleaned up and
abstracted further.

Also your questions on some of the code changes, the rationale for which
is not obvious. Will help to spinkle in some descriptive comments there.

Have fixed up a lot of codying style issues. But there could till be a
few that may spew warning by checkpatch.pl.

There are no functional issues AFAICT.
