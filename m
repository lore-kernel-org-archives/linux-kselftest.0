To the extent that we can unify how tests are written, I agree that
this would be a good thing.  However, you should note that
kselftest_harness.h is currently assums that it will be included in
userspace programs.  This is most obviously seen if you look closely
at the functions defined in the header files which makes calls to
fork(), abort() and fprintf().

So Kunit can't reuse kselftest_harness.h unmodified.  And whether or
not the actual implementation of the header file can be reused or
refactored, making the unit tests use the same or similar syntax would
be a good thing.
