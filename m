Yes, I think you can use uaccess_ttbr0_enable() when we take the
FEAT_LSUI path. What I meant above was for uaccess_enable_privileged()
to avoid PAN disabling if we have FEAT_LSUI as we know all cases would
be executed with user privileges.

Either way, we don't need a new uaccess_enable_futex().

Just spell it out in the commit log that we have a slight ABI change. I
don't think we'll have a problem but it needs at least checking with
some user-space (libc, Android) people.
