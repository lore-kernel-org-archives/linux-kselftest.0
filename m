Yes, QEMU in WSL is one possible example, but the motivation is simply 
to play nicer with running Hyper-V on top of KVM.

Hyper-V appears to use DecodeAssists as one of the requirements before 
enabling nested SVM for its guests.  Exposing it lets users turn on and 
use Hyper-V virtualization features inside a Windows VM when they need 
them, instead of KVM blocking that setup because the virtual SVM model 
is missing this feature.

I'll include that motivation in the next version.


Thanks,
