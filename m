On the dt front, our policy is that it is not the kernel's job to
check that the dt matches the hardware. It is the firmware's job to
accurately report what the hardware is. There's definitely some
exceptions to that already (*cough thead vector cough*) but that's in
part because we failed to come up with concrete descriptions in the
first place.

Yesterday I commented on a patch that was adding this kind of thing:
| The point of validate callbacks is twofold: checking that the kernel
| configuration supports the extension and that extensions that the kernel
| depends on to support the one in question are present.

The latter is because you could depend on an extension that is affected
by the former.
Looking at the list of validate callbacks, I think there are some that
actually don't follow this policy (I saw riscv_ext_zca_depends() that
has no real purpose, but didn't look much further).
I'm not even sure that the validate callback added in this series for
zic64b should be added, it's borderline for me. I'm only really not
objecting to it because it outputs a warning if someone has the
retroactively added extension without the relevant dt/acpi properties
and expects things to work.

Part of me wants to know why we should be going to a bunch of effort to
cover up for inaccurate devicetrees etc. Garbage in -> garbage out and let
them keep the pieces.
That said, if we were to do something with checks, we can't actually
even check everything and my opinion is that either we certify that
everything is VerifiedTM or we don't certify at all.

Cheers,
Conor.
