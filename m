What's the reason for this?

I think the compiler already emits ENDBR markers for returns-twice
functions, which is why longjmp does not use a no-track jump.  Other
architectures require such a proliferation of markers because they do
not support no-track jumps at all.  However, longjmp is arguable a
corner case.  It's not completely safe, like loading a function address
from a RELRO GOT and jumping to it.

There's no IBT support planned for i686, that's why we dropped all
marker instructions in Fedora.

Yes, compilers generate landing pads for returns-twice functions.  Not
ideal, but it's the only way to get setjmp working on targets without
NOTRACK.

For Fedora, please coordinate with Arjun (Cc:ed), who is going through
the motions of enabling SHSTK for real.

Would software enforcement be a possibility?  The kernel could check if
the landing pad is there.

Thanks,
