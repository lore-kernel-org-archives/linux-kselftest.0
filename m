From: Hui Zhu <zhuhui@kylinos.cn>

This series lets a BPF program decide when to trigger memcg reclaim
and how aggressively to do it, based on whatever runtime signal it
chooses to observe -- rather than reclaim only being triggered once a
cgroup's usage crosses a fixed threshold. The core idea is a pair of
new kfuncs, bpf_proactive_reclaim() and
bpf_proactive_reclaim_swappiness(), which give BPF direct access to
the proactive reclaim path so this decision can be made in BPF policy
rather than hard-coded threshold logic.

This was originally part of a larger series posted here [1].
That series also adds a memcg BPF struct_ops (memcg_charged,
memcg_uncharged, below_low, below_min) for synchronous, in-line memory
protection decisions. That mechanism and this one solve different
problems -- struct_ops hooks run inline on the charge/reclaim path,
while the kfuncs here are for asynchronous, out-of-band reclaim
decided independently by a BPF program -- so they are reviewed as
separate series. This series carries only the async reclaim piece.

Compared to v1, the kfunc interface has been reworked based on review
feedback: instead of a thin wrapper around
try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages() exposing raw gfp/reclaim-option knobs,
the series now provides use-case-driven kfuncs that perform one
proactive reclaim pass with the same parameters memory.reclaim uses.
The bpf_thread_wq patches from v1 (old patches 2-3) are dropped from
this series: following the discussion in [2], the cgroup-aware
workqueue is being superseded by a disaggregated set of async
primitives (bpf_kthread/bpf_waitq) that will be developed separately
(discussion in [3]), and the selftest now queues its reclaim work
through bpf_wq.

Patch 1 adds bpf_proactive_reclaim() and
bpf_proactive_reclaim_swappiness(), sleepable kfuncs that perform one
reclaim pass on a target memcg, like a write to memory.reclaim: swap
is allowed, and the anon/file balance follows the cgroup's swappiness
or an explicit override in [MIN_SWAPPINESS, MAX_SWAPPINESS] plus
SWAPPINESS_ANON_ONLY. Both go through a shared helper,
bpf_proactive_reclaim_pages(), which guards against reclaim recursion
and calls try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages() with GFP_KERNEL and
MEMCG_RECLAIM_MAY_SWAP | MEMCG_RECLAIM_PROACTIVE, the same parameters
user_proactive_reclaim() uses, and unlike memory.reclaim they do not
retry until the requested size is reached. Both refuse to run when
the caller already holds PF_MEMALLOC or has a non-NULL
current->reclaim_state, since a nested try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages()
would clobber the outer reclaim's current->reclaim_state (e.g. MGLRU
dereferences current->reclaim_state->mm_walk); the reclaim_state
check also closes the window where try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages() has
installed it but not yet set PF_MEMALLOC, reachable by a sleepable
program attaching fentry to the generated trace iterator function.
The size argument and the return value are both in bytes, matching
the byte-based unit of bpf_mem_cgroup_usage() and
bpf_mem_cgroup_page_state() so callers can mix them without manual
page/byte conversions. An out-of-range swappiness is reported with
(unsigned long)-1 rather than 0, since 0 cannot be told apart from a
pass that reclaimed nothing.

Patch 2 (selftests/bpf: add memcg async reclaim test) ties the kfuncs
into a worked example: it watches the WORKINGSET_REFAULT_FILE counter
of a high-priority cgroup as a proxy for memory-pressure impact, and
once it starts climbing, proactively reclaims memory from a
low-priority cgroup via bpf_proactive_reclaim(), with the reclaim
work queued asynchronously through bpf_wq. The test asserts that the
monitored cgroup's workload finishes faster once async reclaim kicks
in, and -- as timing alone cannot distinguish a working reclaim from
a no-op one -- that the BPF program actually made reclaim calls and
reclaimed bytes, via counters it exports through its .bss. This
demonstrates the end-to-end use case: BPF observes pressure on the
cgroup it wants to protect, and reclaims from the cgroup it wants to
reclaim from, in one self-contained mechanism. Note that, without
bpf_thread_wq, the CPU cost of the reclaim work is not yet attributed
to a chosen cgroup; that part waits for the async primitives work
mentioned above.

Changelog:
v4:
According to the comments of bot+bpf-ci and sashiko, also check
current->reclaim_state to close the fentry-on-trace-iter recursion
window in bpf_in_reclaim_context.
Return bytes instead of pages ( nr * PAGE_SIZE ) in
bpf_proactive_reclaim_pages and bpf_proactive_reclaim_swappiness.
Return (unsigned long)-1 on out-of-range swappiness (was 0).
Kdoc of both kfuncs: updated Return descriptions; added FS-lock deadlock
warning to bpf_proactive_reclaim.
Fix potential child process leak in selftests.
Use _exit() instead of exit() in forked children in selftests.
Rename reclaimed_pages to reclaimed_bytes in selftests.
Fix comments issues in selftests.
v3:
According to the comments of bot+bpf-ci, add a shared helper
bpf_proactive_reclaim_pages() that is called by bpf_proactive_reclaim
and bpf_proactive_reclaim_swappiness.
According to the comments of sashiko and bot+bpf-ci, fix the issues of
selftests.
v2:
According to the comments of Shakeel Butt, replace
bpf_try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages() with
bpf_proactive_reclaim(memcg, size) and
bpf_proactive_reclaim_swappiness(memcg, size, swappiness).
According to the comments of Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi, drop patch 2
and patch 3.
Remove bpf_thread_wq code in patch 4.
According to the comments of sashiko-bot, fix the issues of selftests.
