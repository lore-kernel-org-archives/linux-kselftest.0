I have incorporated almost all of your comments. But there are some
comments that take some effort to implement. Shall we get the patches
merged in the current form?  This code has been sitting out for a while.

In the current form its tested and works on powerpc and on x86, and
incorporates about 95% of your suggestions. The rest I will take care
as we go.
