Subject: [PATCH v12 00/22] selftests, powerpc, x86 : Memory Protection Keys
Message-ID: <1519264541-7621-1-git-send-email-linuxram@us.ibm.com>

Memory protection keys enables an application to protect its address space from
inadvertent access by its own code.

This feature is now enabled on powerpc architecture and integrated in
4.16-rc1.  The patches move the selftests to arch neutral directory
and enhance their test coverage. 

Test
----
Verified for correctness on powerpc
and on x86 architectures(using EC2 ubuntu VM instance).

History:
-------

version 12: 
	(1) fixed the offset of pkey field in the siginfo structure for
		x86_64 and powerpc. And tries to use the actual field
		if the headers have it defined.
version 11:
	(1) fixed a deadlock in the ptrace testcase.

version 10 and prior:
	(1) moved the testcase to arch neutral directory
	(2) split the changes into incremental patches.
