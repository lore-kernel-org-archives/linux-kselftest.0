This is really cool, thank you so much for spending the cycles to test.

I'm working on getting a v6 out soon.  Glad to see the progress!

Yes, this is expected, and I think there are questions about how it
should be optimized both in a provisioning sense and a software sense.

For example, exposing a full memory expander as 100% compressible may
not make sense - given that this could many a lot of memory.  I have
some data that shows it may make more sense to split a memory expander
into two regions to better fit the compressible region to meet the
actual capacity the cold-tail is capable of consuming.

On the software side there may be some ability to adjust this at
runtime with hotplug instead of requiring a reboot, but I think that
needs to be experimented with.

Great! I also have some TaoBench and fio results i'm looking to share,
glad to have some additional peer review using Tao.

Agreed, i'm looking forward to getting past the isolation bits and get
more focused on the compression implementation details.

Very similar to my test setup, seems like good signal we are of similar
mind on the use case.  (For readers: there was no coordination here).

I personally did not test private-node without write protection,
although it makes sense to test the throughput of a demotion-only
node as a baseline.  Smart.

My guess is there was probably a reclaim throughput issue, or there may
have been a bug in the v4/v5 code.  I will look at adding some pressure
tests to my suite that test demotion-only explicitly.

- allocator waits for migration?
  
  Yes.  And worse, once the node is full, migration will fail and you'll
  swap directly from the top tier and reduce your reclaim behavior on
  the lower node.  It becomes very important to push proactive reclaim
  on a demotion-only tier to ensure there is sufficient headroom to
  receive demotions in the future, since direct-reclaim basically never
  targets a lower-tier on the first pass.

  There's a big discussion about whether tiered systems need to invert
  their reclaim behavior (reclaim from the lowest node first to find
  progress there, then do demotion - rather than the other way around).

- Hot pages in dram 

  Also yes.  The comparison to make isn't only against a raw CXL node,
  but also against Zswap or Zram or Swap.  How does the workload fair
  on a system with 16GB RAM and 32GB Zswap/Swap?

  This is important context.

These latency results suggest to me that the memory being tested was
always DRAM, though the initial memory fault would have been CXL.

i.e. even if the memory was faulted directly onto the node via
mempolicy, the very first write to it would have caused promotion.

If you dropped the write protection you'd probably see it equals the
baseline.

The bandwidth numbers support this.  Higher stall, but faster latency
means the migration was more beneficial for latency than letting the
memory sit on CXL.

Neat.  I'm not sure these results are particularly useful in describing
how a workload would react.

Was this memory hotplugged via cram.c or did you replicate the code and
hotplug it another way?  If so, did you hotplug it as ZONE_NORMAL or
ZONE_MOVABLE?

For a compressed tier, it must always be hotplugged as ZONE_MOVABLE,
without exception, because otherwise it can allow a GUP pin or kernel
allocation that would eventually become permanently stuck there - and by
definition of a compression tier must be 100% movable memory.
