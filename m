I do not know of any use case that cares, my point was that since we need to
implement it in the generic library for some architectures, for symmetry we can
extend it to all the architectures that support the generic vdso library.

Totally agree on this.

My understanding, based on [1] and [2] is that the version defines the minimum
kernel version from when a specific symbols is exposed and whenever this symbol
is requested from the vDSO the correct version needs to be specified.
Every "new" library, dealing with an "old" kernel, compliant with the exposed
ABI should implement the vDSO calls in this way and provide a fallback if the
vDSO function is not present (i.e. [3]).
