I've looked into plain ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION-based injection and it
is not very useful.  I didn't even now eBPF could use it, but I
looked into other eBPF injections and at least for my uses cases
it was a bit of a mess.  I'd have to allow access to certain bio
fields and would have create a stable UAPI for commands and status
using the fake BTF struct access which really would not be a good
idea here as we need to be able to change internals.  Additionally
having fully BTF-enabled toolchains in test VMs is not great either.

I've also not actually found any good map type for range lookups,
which is kinda essential here.

I don't think pulling in ebpftrace for simple error injection is a
winning proposition..

I'm not sure a single hand waivy comment counts as rejection, although
I'm not a huge fan of setup_fault_attr - it makes a mess of debugfs and
creates a lot of boilerplate for a single not very much configurable call
site.  That might be ok for something like the make_request case
(although I think we can do better as shown in this patch), but for
making random functions fail it is a lot of overhead.  These injections
points also are not anywhere near stable enough to be exposed.
