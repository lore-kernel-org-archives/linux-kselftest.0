Ah.. it has to be taken out from the Makefile of
/home/linux/tools/testing/selftests/x86/

The sources have been moved to /home/linux/tools/testing/selftests/mm/

No. But building it 32-bit after moving it to a the new directory 
needs some special code in the Makefile.

Dave Hansen did mention it, but he did not complain too much. So I kept
quite.

yes.

I wish I could get a x86 machine which could do memory keys. Had a AWS
instance, but struggled to boot my kernel. Can't get to the console...
gave up.  If someone can give me a ready-made machine with support for
memkeys, I can quickly fix all the outstanding x86 issues.  But if
someone can just fix it for me, ....  ;)
