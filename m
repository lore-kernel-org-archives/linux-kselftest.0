Hi Vincenzo,

If I correctly understand what you are proposing, I'm not sure if that
would work with the countless number of different ioctl calls. For
example when an ioctl accepts a struct with a bunch of pointer fields.
In this case a shim like the one you propose can't live in userspace,
since libc doesn't know about the interface of all ioctls, so it can't
know which fields to untag. The kernel knows about those interfaces
(since the kernel implements them), but then we would need a custom
shim for each ioctl variation, which doesn't seem practical.

Thanks!
