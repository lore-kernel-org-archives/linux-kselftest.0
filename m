The reason Vincenzo hasn't posted his patches yet is that we are still
debating internally how to document which syscalls accept non-zero
top-byte, what to do with future syscalls for which we don't know the
semantics.

Happy to take the discussion to the public list if Vincenzo posts his
patches. The conclusion of the ABI discussion may have an impact on the
actual implementation that you are proposing in this series.
