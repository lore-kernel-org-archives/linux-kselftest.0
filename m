Hmm. I do not really understand the question... Sure, do_sys_poll() does
poll_freewait() before sysret or even before return from syscall, but why
does this matter? This is the exit path, it frees the memory, does fput(),
etc, f_op->poll() won't be call after that.

No. Please note the pwq->triggered check and please read __pollwake().

But if you want to understand this you can forget about poll/select. It is
a bit complicated, in particular because it has to do set_current_state()
right  before schedule() and thus it plays games with pwq->triggered. But in
essence this doesn't differ too much from the plain wait_event-like code
(although you can also look at wait_woken/woken_wake_function).

If remove_wait_queue() could happem before wake_up_all() (like in your pseudo-
code above), then pidfd_poll() or any other ->poll() method could miss _both_
the condition and wakeup. But sys_poll() doesn't do this, so it is fine to miss
the condition and rely on wake_up_all() which ensures we won't block and the
next iteration must see condition == T.

Oleg.
