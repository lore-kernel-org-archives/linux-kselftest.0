Sure. I was thinking about other usecases. For example, sometimes in
userspace you want to do the following:
save_fd = dup(fd, <well-known-number-at-the-end-of-the-range);
close_range(3, (save_fd - 1));

Which brings me to another point. So even if we don't do close_range() I
would like libc to maybe give us something like close_range() for such
scenarios.
