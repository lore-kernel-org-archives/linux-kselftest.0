Yes.

Yes, for the reason state below.

That assumes the fields even exists in this form.  And we definitively
need to do things about the iter going ahead.  In other words we have
to build up a huge abstraction here first.

libbpf and BTF support is what I mean.  And of course whatever code
you write to communicate with it as a simple shell script won't work
any more.

Which means I need to write eBPF code for every specific range I
want to inject, which makes the thing very hard to use.

As said before, I prototyped it and it was a mess.  Having about 300
lines of simple code that can be directly used from a shell script
seems much preferable.
