This is definitely worth discussing, and probably in need of fixing (aka
something in rr seems to have broken).

We definitely need protection against the race with sigaction.

The fundamental question becomes does it make sense and is it safe
to allow a debugger to stop at, and possibly change these signals.

Stopping at something SA_IMMUTABLE as long as the signal is allowed to
continue and kill the process when PTRACE_CONT happens seems harmless.

Allowing the debugger to change the signal, or change it's handling
I don't know.

All of this is channeled through the following function.

Right now we have 3 conditions that trigger SA_IMMUTABLE.
- The sigdfl parameter is passed asking that userspace not be able to
  change the handling of the signal.

- A synchronous exception is taken and the signal is blocked.

- A synchronous exception is taken and the signal is ignored.

Today because of how things are implemented the code most change the
userspace state to allow the signal to kill the process.  I really want
to get rid of that, because that has other side effects.  As part of
getting rid of changing the state it is my plan to get rid of
SA_IMMUTABLE as well.  If I don't have to allow the debugger to stop and
observe what is happening with the signal that change is much easier to
implement.

The classic trigger of sigdfl is a recursive SIGSEGV.

However we have other cases like SECCOMP_RET_KILL where the kernel
has never allowed userspace to intercept the killing of the
process.  Things that have messages like: "seccomp tried to change
syscall nr or ip"

My brain is drawing a blank on how to analyze those.  

Kees I am back to asking the question I had before I figured out
SA_IMMUTABLE.  Are there security concerns with debuggers intercepting
SECCOMP_RET_KILL.

I think I can modify dequeue_synchronous_signal so that we can perform
the necessary logic in get_signal rather than hack up the signal
handling state in force_sig_info_to_task.

Except for the cases like SECCOMP_RET_KILL where the kernel has never
allowed userspace to intercept the handling.  I don't see any
fundamental reason why ptrace could not intercept the signal.  The
handling is overriden to force the process to die, because the way
userspace is currently configured to handle the signal does not work so
it is necessary to kill the process.

I think there are cases where the userspace state is known to be
sufficiently wrong that the kernel can not safely allow anything more
than inspecting the state.

I can revisit the code to see if the kernel will get confused if
something more is allowed.  Still I really like the current semantics of
SA_IMMUTABLE because these are cases where something wrong.  If someone
miscalculates how things are wrong it could result in the kernel getting
confused and doing the wrong thing.  Allowing the debugger to intercept
the signal requires we risk miscalculating what is wrong.

Kyle how exactly is rr broken?  Certainly a historical usage does not
work.  How does this affect actual real world debugging sessions?

You noticed this and bisected the change quickly so I fully expect
this does affect real world debugging sessions.  I just want to know
exactly how so that exactly what is wrong can be fixed.

As far as I can tell SA_IMMUTABLE has only been backported to v5.15.x
where in cleaning things up I made SECCOMP_RET_KILL susceptible to races
with sigaction, and ptrace.  Those races need to be closed or we need to
decide that we don't actually care if the debugger does things.
