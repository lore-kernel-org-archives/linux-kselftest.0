For context: Josef Bacik introduced it first for BPF only
(BPF_ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION). Masami Hiramatsu then generalized it into
the error injection framework, renaming it to ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION
and adding the fail_function debugfs interface (which calls
should_fail()). So annotating a function with ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION
gives you both backends at once: debugfs (fail_function) and eBPF
(bpf_override_return()).

Agreed, and I had not looked closely enough at the series
before proposing the wrong primitives. ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION /
bpf_override_return() are not sufficient here: bpf_override_return()
cannot set bio->bi_status or call bio_endio(), which I think is the
key operation here.

IIU the series correctly, and oversimplifying: when
injection is enabled and a bio matches, the block layer completes the
bio inline with the chosen blk_status_t (the status= rule from debugfs)
via bio_endio_status(). The submission path returns to the caller
immediately, with the bio already in the error state. Nothing is ever
sent to the device, but the completion path sees the injected error.

submit_bio() -> submit_bio_noacct() -> submit_bio_noacct_nocheck()
      +-- Path 1: no match -> continue normal IO submission
      +-- Path 2: match (diskN) -> blk_error_inject()
                     -> bio_endio_status(bio, inj->status)
                          -> bio_endio()
                     // error injected. bio completed

So this is bio mutating + a bio_endio() call, not a return override.
That can't be solved with ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION. But we can use
BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS instead: the kernel keeps ownership of the
bio_endio_status() call, and the eBPF program only drives the policy,
ie. which blk_status_t to return for a given bio, based on whatever 
heuristics it implements.

> I'd have to allow access to certain bio

With struct_ops the bio is passed to the ebpf side as read-only, bio 
fields can be read to decide the policy but cannot write them. Is 
read-only access to bio fields itself a concern?

That should not be a problem at all. With CO-RE (compile once, run
everywhere) the program resolves the bio field offsets against the
BTF of the kernel it loads on, so it adapts dynamically if the layout
changes. The contract is just the struct_ops callback signature: a
struct bio * argument and a blk_status_t return. And that doesn't imply
any UAPI commitment AFAIK.

Are you referring to the old BCC toolchain requirements [1]? This is
solved in CO-RE [2]. The toolchain (Clang/LLVM, pahole) stays on the
build host; the test VM only needs the prebuilt BPF object, libbpf at
runtime, and the kernel's own BTF (CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF). No compiler
or BTF toolchain is required inside the VM. Clang/LLVM 10+ is enough to
build CO-RE libbpf tools [3].

Are you referring to the bio sector range comparison in
__blk_error_inject()? I don't think that needs to be delegated to a
BPF map (Documentation/bpf/maps.rst). The ebpf side has direct access
to the bio fields, so it can apply the same sector/op filtering
__blk_error_inject() does today. That match is already a linear list
walk, so the ebpf program just runs the same [start, end] condition
check.

In summary: what do you think of evolving this series
into eBPF, but BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS instead of
ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION/bpf_override_return()?. The configurable debugfs
injection is a nice enhancement over what we had, but the matching is
static (op/start/nr_sectors/status/chance) per gendisk. A struct_ops
hook would expand the failure model to anything derivable from the bio
(plus any state the program keeps), with the kernel still owning the
bio_endio_status() mutation and only the policy moving out of the tree.
The benefit is the flexibility to express the policy without hard-coding
the model in the kernel.

The open question is whether programmable injection is something we want
to support in-tree, or whether more debugfs knobs suffice. Thoughts?
