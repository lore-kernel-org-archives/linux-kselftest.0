No, several of these are wrong, and just silence a warning that shows a problem.

So for example:

this actually looks correct.

But:

This looks actively wrong. The whole - and only - point of
"__chk_user_ptr()" is that it warns about a lack of a "__user *" type.

So the above makes no sense at all.

There are other similar "that makes no sense what-so-ever", like this one:

> -               struct compat_group_req __user *gr32 = (void *)optval;
> +               struct compat_group_req __user *gr32 = (__force void *)optval;

no, the additionl of __force is not the right thing, the problem, is
that a __user pointer is cast to a non-user 'void *' only to be
assigned to another user type.

The fix should have been to use (void __user *) as the cast instead,
no __force needed.

In general, I think the patch shows all the signs of "mindlessly just
add casts", which is exactly the wrong thing to do to sparse warnings.
