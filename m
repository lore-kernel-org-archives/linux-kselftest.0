The subject title is "Add polling support to pidfd", but ok I should write a
better commit message.

Generally the "how" in the patch should be in the code, but ok.

I changed the first 3 paragraphs of the changelog to the following, is that
better? :

Android low memory killer (LMK) needs to know when a process dies once
it is sent the kill signal. It does so by checking for the existence of
/proc/pid which is both racy and slow. For example, if a PID is reused
between when LMK sends a kill signal and checks for existence of the
PID, since the wrong PID is now possibly checked for existence.

This patch adds polling support to pidfd. Using the polling support, LMK
will be able to get notified when a process exists in race-free and fast
way, and allows the LMK to do other things (such as by polling on other
fds) while awaiting the process being killed to die.

For notification to polling processes, we follow the same existing
mechanism in the kernel used when the parent of the task group is to be
notified of a child's death (do_notify_parent).  This is precisely when
the tasks waiting on a poll of pidfd are also awakened in this patch.

If this bothers you too much, I can also just remove the CC list from the
changelog here, and include it in my invocation of git-send-email instead..
but I have seen commits in the tree that don't follow this rule.

If you look at the CC list of the email, people in the get_maintainer.pl
script were also added. I did run get_maintainer.pl and checkpatch. But ok, I
will add the folks you are suggesting as well. Thanks.

No issues on that, but I am wondering if he should also be in MAINTAINERS
file somewhere such that get_maintainer.pl does pick him up. I added him.

Done.

Done, I added all of them and CC will go out to them next time. Thanks.

Ok, done. thanks.

Ok, I'll add a comment.

I am a bit confused. What specific changes to this patch are you proposing?
This patch makes poll block until the process exits. In the future, we can
make it unblock for a other reasons as well, that's fine with me. I don't see
how this patch prevents such extensions.

Ok, will do.
