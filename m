Yes, I agree. I will try to layout the plan.

End goal of this series is to preserve VM memory which is backed by
guest_memfd. Not all VM are backed by guest_memfd. So preservation of
KVM (vm_file) is independent of preservation of guest_memfd.
But guest_memefd can not be preserved without preserving the KVM (vm_file).
So I agree to your suggestion:

diff --git virt/kvm/Makefile.kvm virt/kvm/Makefile.kvm
index d047d4cf58c9..e6f098498795 100644
--- virt/kvm/Makefile.kvm

Guest_memfd can't be created alone without struct kvm
(kvm_gmem_create() and KVM_GMEM_CREATE ioctl). This is how
guest_memfd has been designed. I don't want to break this design which
has been accepted upstream after lot of discussion.

So while LUO preserve guest_memfd's data, It just preserve the PFNs
value, few flags that belongs to the guest_memfd.

On restore side in new kernel, These PFNs, flags will be populated
to a _newly_ created guest_memfd. that is how preservation and
retrieval works. So To create this new guest_memfd, We need struct
kvm (vm_file). this vm_file must be the same VM which had this
guest_memfd in old kernel, So we preserve the vm_file, get its TOKEN
preserve with guest_memfd and during restore, we create the guest_memfd
with the same VM (vm_file/struct kvm).

I agree, I did not do good job explaining things in commit message. I
will make sure to update them in next revision.

Like, guest_memfd needs struct kvm to create itself. struct kvm (vm_file) needs
vm_type to create itself (kvm_create_vm() or KVM_CREATE_VM IOCTL). LUO
does not provde functionality to pass any subsystem specific arguments. So
vm_type needs to be preserved even though, userspace is aware about it.

So Why do we preserve only vm_type:  To keep things simple for this
series, As target is guest_memfd.

Currently I dont have discreet plan on what else will
,in future, be needed to be preserved. Which I agree not a absoulute right
way to approach. I will layout a rough plan on KVM side preservation.

Having this need for backward compatiblity: I responded here:
