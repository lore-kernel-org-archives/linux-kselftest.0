Whether systemd, Android or OpenWrt adopt something isn't a decision the
kernel gets to make and it isn't one it has to make. Merging code doesn't
create adoption. It creates an obligation to keep the behavior working
forever. That includes the machines whose owners never asked for it.

It's also not how ELF conventions get established. PT_GNU_STACK and
PT_GNU_PROPERTY are the two OS-range headers our loader acts on. And
they came out of the toolchain and we implemented them afterwards.

The one time we picked a program header type ourselves ahead of the ABI
PT_ARM_MEMTAG_MTE in 761b9b366cec we collided with PT_AARCH64_UNWIND
and had to change the name and the value three months later. We got away
with it because it's a coredump segment that gdb reads, not the exec
behavior of every binary on the system.

If you want systemd, Android and OpenWrt to agree on one marker, the
thing that produces that agreement is generic-abi with binutils and
glibc/musl on board, and then we can implement it.

So we don't actually disagree about there being an ELF feature. We
disagree about what the header means. My position is that the header
names the intent and userspace implements the resolution. Yours is that
the kernel does both.

The kernel can't establish this convention. It can only implement one.
If binutils won't emit the header and no loader cooperates, we've shipped
uapi that nothing uses and that we still can't remove.

Sure, but nothing merged today is widely available tomorrow. Both need a
new kernel. Uniform-by-default doesn't arrive sooner because it went
into core elf.

And a new phdr doesn't degrade nicely. On any kernel that doesn't know
it the binary has no PT_INTERP it loads as static. Dies horribly at an
unrelocated _start.

And keeping a literal $ORIGIN fallback in PT_INTERP instead and old
kernels or gVisor open it cwd-relative, so an attacker who controls cwd
plants ./$ORIGIN/ld.so.

Not testbench as in "go away and come back later". The difference is
where the semantics live once they turn out to be wrong. Get a corner
case wrong in a bpf handler and the distro ships a fix in the next
update. Get it wrong in load_elf_binary() and it's the exec behavior of
arbitrary binaries... which we can't change afterwards.

Nobody is asking an admin to name a program header type. The distro ships
the handler and a file in /etc/binfmt.d and the admin never sees either.

But note what you argued here... If it needs an enable/disable switch
then it is policy. And the only question left is what the switch looks
like. A global boot-time on/off is the worst available version of it.
It's one bit, machine-wide and can't be scoped to a subtree, can't be
delegated.

The handler doing nothing but string manipulation isn't a simplification
in the example. It's the design. The program never opens anything. It
computes a path and hands it back, and the kernel opens it with
open_exec() under the credentials of whoever called execve(). There is
no openat() to add. And fwiw, it also supports pre-opened binaries for
really crazy use-cases where you want to pin a set of loaders once.

The module RFC resolved $ORIGIN in kernel code opened the interpreter
itself with file_open_root(..., O_RDONLY, 0).
That skips everything open_exec() does and it achors path resolution at
the binary's directory. .. clamps there and absolute symlinks resolve
inside it. $ORIGIN/../lib/ld.so, which is the RPATH idiom everyone
actually writes, silently means <bindir>/lib/ld.so.

I'm not holding an RFC to final-code standards. The point is that this
is fiddly.

It doesn't delegate the risk. It binds it to whoever wants the feature.

Whether resolving the loader relative to the binary is safe depends on
invariants of the deployment. Is the tree immutable, who may write to it,
which prefixes are trusted. The kernel doesn't know any of that.
/nix/store is root-owned and immutable, so the policy is safe there. The
same semantics pointed at a directory the user can write to is a hole.
Only the deployment can tell those two apart.

Userspace arrived at the same answer, incidentally. glibc expands $ORIGIN
under __libc_enable_secure only when it is the first path component and
the result is rooted in a trusted directory. That trusted-directory
notion is exactly what an in-kernel implementation would have to invent.
And it is deployment-specific.

Right, and that's the honest core of it. The people who need this are
users on machines that someone else administers.

But "default-enabled ELF feature" is a strange shape of fix for it.
Because the machines you'd be enabling it on belong to the people who
never asked. This proposals is to change what exec does for everyone
else in order to serve some use-cases.

And there is such a thing. The distro ships the object plus a file in
/etc/binfmt.d and systemd loads it at boot. That is a default-loaded
program with an option to disable, it just lives in the distro image
rather than in vmlinux. If one handler ends up being what everybody
ships, that's the uniformity you're after, and nobody had to freeze
resolution semantics to get it. Could even be upstream in systemd.

I'd rather not, for the reasons above.
