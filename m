I had a version of this in the original openat2(2) pull request many
years ago[1].

Unfortunately there is a pretty big issue with doing it this way (which
I mentioned in one of the changelogs back then[2]): There are lots of
VFS operations that imply operations on a file (through a magic-link)
that are not blocked. truncate(2) and mount(MS_BIND)/open_tree(2) are
the most problematic examples, but this applies to basically any syscall
that takes a path argument. If you don't block those then re-opening
restrictions are functionally useless.

It also would be really nice if you could block more than just trailing
component operations -- having a directory file descriptor that blocks
lookups could be quite handy for a bunch of reasons.

I think the only workable solution to block all of these issue entirely
and in a comprehensive way is to have something akin to capsicum
capabilities[3] tied to file descriptors and have all of the VFS
operations check them (though I think that the way this was attempted in
the past[4] was far from ideal).

I have tried my hand at a few lighter-weight prototypes over the years
(mainly trying to add the necessary checks to every generic_permission()
call, and adding some more generic_permission() calls as well...). My
last prototype was adding the restriction information to "struct path"
but that would bloat too many structures to be merge-able. I was
planning on looking at this again later this year, but if you can come
up with a nice way of getting a minimal version of capsicum working,
that'd be amazing. :D

That being said, while my view at the time of openat2(2) was that we
need to do this at the same time as O_EMPTYPATH (and my tests showed
that this was a backwards-compatible change -- on modern desktops at
least), at this point I think it'd be better to just merge O_EMPTYPATH
by itself and we can work on this hardening separately and make it an
opt-in sysctl (with individual file descriptors being opt-in-able as
well).

Way back then, Andy Lutomirski suggested that this be done via the
magic-link modes. While it is kind of ugly and in my patchset this
required adjusting some magic-link modes, it does provide a useful
indication to userspace of two things:

 - What upgrade modes are available for a file (this is useful for
   debugging but is also really necessary for the checkpoint-restore
   folks' needs). I did this with fmode (and exposed fmode in fdinfo)
   but I would not recommend that approach at all.

 - It indicates whether the kernel supports this feature, which will
   allow certain programs to loosen their hardening logic since the
   kernel implements the hardening for them.

   For instance, most container runtimes now either make a copy of
   /proc/self/exe as a sealed memfd or create a read-only overlayfs
   mount to re-exec /proc/self/exe so that containers cannot overwrite
   the host binary by doing a /proc/$pid/exe re-open. See CVE-2019-5736
   for more details.

   Indicating that the kernel blocks this attack would let container
   runtimes disable this hardening on such kernels.

Maybe we should at least change the modes even if they aren't used?

This should restrict writes, for the reasons outlined above.

This should also restrict writes (this is a similar issue to
/proc/self/exe and is harder to harden against, the primary defense is
just ASLR...).

I'm not a huge fan of how this bitmask is set up, to be honest. I get
that you did it this way to make it disable-by-default but given that we
probably will want to add restrictions in the future that would break
backward compatibility (imagine an execute restriction that blocks
execve(2) -- adding the feature would break all existing programs if you
follow this scheme).

It probably makes more sense to do something more like statx(2) -- you
pick the restrictions you want and get back information about which
restrictions were supported. This is similar to what I did in the old
patchset too, though it didn't give you information like statx(2) does.
