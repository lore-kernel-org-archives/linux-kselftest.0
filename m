(Dave Hansen: please correct me if I miss-speak below)

As per the current semantics of sys_pkey_free(); the way I understand it,
the calling thread is saying disassociate me from this key. Other
threads continue to be associated with the key and could continue to
get key-faults, but this calling thread will not get key-faults on that
key any more.

Also the key should not get reallocated till all the threads in the process
have disassocated from the key; by calling sys_pkey_free().

Sorry. I was not thinking right. Let me restate.

A key is a global resource, but the permissions on a key is
local to a thread. For eg: the same key could disable
access on a page for one thread, while it could disable write
on the same page on another thread.

thanks. will try the test case with my kernel patches. But, on
powerpc one can change the permissions on the key in the signal handler
which takes into effect immediately, there should not be a bug
in powerpc.

x86 has this requirement where it has to return from the signal handler
back to the kernel in order to change the permission on a key,
it can cause issues with longjump.
