Thanks for investigating. You can fix those three places in your code
but I was rather looking for a way to check such casting in the future
for newly added code. While for the khwasan we can assume it's a debug
option, the tagged user pointers are ABI and we need to keep it stable.

We could we actually add some macros for explicit conversion between
__user ptr and long and silence the warning there (I guess this would
work better for sparse). We can then detect new ptr to long casts as
they appear. I just hope that's not too intrusive.

(I haven't tried the sparse patch yet, hopefully sometime this week)
