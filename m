So I'm not particularly proud of the result, but I found a rather
ugly way to figure out if we are currently in thumb mode within an
inline asm, and restore that mode: test the length of a nop
instruction with a ".if" asm statement.

Do we want to go for this kind of approach, or should we revert
back to a ".word" and accept that the rseq signature before the
abort handler will be seen as data rather than an instruction
on arm32 ?

Is there a better way to do this ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
