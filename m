That's probably the best option. I initially used this wording because I was worried 
that there could be cases where the kernel allocates "magic" memory for userspace 
that is MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, but in fact it's probably not the case (presumably 
such mapping should always be done via install_special_mapping(), which is definitely 
not MAP_PRIVATE).

I think that Documentation/arm64/tagged-pointers.txt already makes it reasonably 
clear (anyway, with the architecture not supporting it, you can't expect much from 
the kernel).
