Do you have an idea of how much of the user/kernel interface is covered
by this workload?

It looks like there's been a lot of progress made here towards smoking
out most of the sites in the kernel where pointers need to be untagged.

However, I do think that we need a clear policy for how existing kernel
interfaces are to be interpreted in the presence of tagged pointers.
Unless we have that nailed down, we are likely to be able to make only
vague guarantees to userspace about what works, and the ongoing risk
of ABI regressions and inconsistencies seems high.

I don't really see how we can advertise a full system interface if we
know some subset of it doesn't work for foreseeable userspace
environments.  I feel that presenting the current changes as an ABI
relaxation may be a recipe for future problems, since the forwards
compatibility guarantees we're able to make today are few and rather
vague.

Can we define an opt-in for tagged-pointer userspace, that rejects all
syscalls that we haven't checked and whitelisted (or that are
uncheckable like ioctl)?  This reflects the reality that we don't have
a regular userspace environment in which standards-compliant software
that uses address tags in a reasonable way will just work.

It might be feasible to promote this to be enabled by default later on,
if it becomes sufficiently complete.


In the meantime, I think we really need to nail down the kernel's
policies on

 * in the default configuration (without opt-in), is the presence of
non-address bits in pointers exchanged with the kernel simply
considered broken?  (Even with this series, the de factor answer
generally seems to be "yes", although many specific things will now
work fine)

 * if not, how do we tighten syscall / interface specifications to
describe what happens with pointers containing non-address bits, while
keeping the existing behaviour for untagged pointers?

We would want a general recipe that gives clear guidance on what
userspace should expect an arbitrarily chosen syscall to do with its
pointers, without having to enumerate each and every case.

To be sustainable, we would also need to solve that in a way that
doesn't need to be reintented per-arch.


There may already be some background on these topics -- can you throw me
a link if so?
