 Thanks Daniel, Alexis, and Emil.

  Moving the test to tools/testing/selftests/drivers/net/hw/ appears to
  require more than relocating the shell script. The xdp_features userspace
  tool, BPF program, skeleton build rules, and test environment would also
  need to be adapted to the net driver selftest framework.

  Would it be acceptable to take the process lifecycle fix as a v3 in its
  current location, followed by a separate migration series?

  I would also be happy to work on the migration. If you would prefer to
  see the migration before this fix is applied, I can prepare v3 as a
  small series, keeping the framework migration and the process lifecycle
  changes separate where practical.

  Thanks,
  Bochao
