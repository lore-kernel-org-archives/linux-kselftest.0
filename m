Hi,

Based on the discussion on Bi-weekly guest_memfd upstream call.

The following suggestions are made:
1. Remove the prefaulted condition and During preservation, let the VMM
   have the policy to either pause the VM or avoid any upcoming faults/conversion
   (conversion is not part of this series, but design concept for future
   extension) occurs. If new fault/conversion requests are originated,
   Kernel will return error to notify VMM.

   In future, We will revisit if this functionality can be extended
   to handle post-preserve fault/conversion with having data on preservation
   latency and complexity. Pratyush is already working on implementing
   similar thing for memfd and hugetlb preservation.

2. We are going with preserving the vm file along with guest_memfd file

3. No need to preserve kvm->mem_attr_array, as this is on deprecating
   path and For this series, where only fully shared guest_memfd is
   supported for liveupdate, preservation of these attributes not
   required.

Due to time constraints:
we have one open Question left:
1. How to check guest_memfd is fully shared. Currently that is being
   done by INIT_SHARED flag. But with in-place it is going to change
   its meaning and it will mean only durng the creation of guest_memfd
   it is shared whose folios can be converted to private.
   So for this series, I am looking for suggestion, what is the best way
   to find the sharedness of guest_memfd which will be compatible with
   in-place series. OR we can go like this (my personnel recommendation):

   if (guest_memfd_is_fully_shared())
      return true; // support the preservation

   // This series
   int guest_memfd_is_fully_shared(void) {
       if (guest_memfd->flags & GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_INIT_SHARED)
          return true;
         return false;
   }

   TO::
   // Once in-place conversion series lands.
   int guest_memfd_is_fully_shared(void) {
       if (No Private flags in (guest_memfd->attributes))
          return true;
         return false;
   }
