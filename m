Well, I think accepting a NULL buffer would be much cleaner; but keep
in mind that I'm just someone making suggestions, Al Viro is the one
who has to like your code. :P

I think that might be a sensible change; but as I said, I don't
actually know whether it's necessary, and it would be very helpful if
