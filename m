	It would be even more useful if that series would either deal with
the noise for real ("that's what we intend here, that's what we intend there,
here's a primitive for such-and-such kind of cases, here we actually
ought to pass __user pointer instead of unsigned long", etc.) or left it
unmasked.

	As it is, __force says only one thing: "I know the code is doing
the right thing here".  That belongs in primitives, and I do *not* mean the
#define cast_to_ulong(x) ((__force unsigned long)(x))
kind.

	Folks, if you don't want to deal with that - leave the warnings be.
They do carry more information than "someone has slapped __force in that place".

Al, very annoyed by that kind of information-hiding crap...
