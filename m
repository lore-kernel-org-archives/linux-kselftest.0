One major difference: kselftest requires a userspace environment; it
starts systemd, requires a root file system from which you can load
modules, etc.  Kunit doesn't require a root file system; doesn't
require that you start systemd; doesn't allow you to run arbitrary
perl, python, bash, etc. scripts.  As such, it's much lighter weight
than kselftest, and will have much less overhead before you can start
running tests.  So it's not really the same kind of virtualization.

Does this help?
