Oh that's much better Oleg, and would avoid the race I had in mind: Basically
I was acquiring the tasklist_lock to avoid a case where a polling task is not
woken up because it was added to the waitqueue too late. The reading of the
exit_state and the conditional adding to the wait queue, needed to be atomic.
Otherwise something like the following may be possible:

Task A (poller)		Task B (exiting task being polled)
------------            ----------------
poll() called
			exit_state is set to non-zero
read exit_state
			wake_up_all()

add_wait_queue()
----------------------------------------------

However, in your code above, it is avoided because we get:

Task A (poller)		Task B (exiting task being polled)
------------            ----------------
poll() called
add_wait_queue()
			exit_state is set to non-zero
read exit_state
remove_wait_queue()
			wake_up_all()

I don't see any other issues with your code above so I can try it out and
update the patches. Thanks.

Seems like you are replying to Christian's point. I agree with you.

Yes, pid_task() should do it. Will update it. Thanks!
