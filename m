Hi Mimi,

Thank you for help about the pointer about IMA testing.
Probably I should cc list as well since we are talking about the patch
itself.  For the ima test itself I could still ask for help in a private
email thread.

Did a test with a embedded ima key in kernel, with secure boot disabled,
but with Secure Boot enabled, but failed to sign the kernel with both
pesign and evmctl, will continue to see how to work on it and ask in
private email if needed :)

About the patch itself, as we talked in another email, I would expect it
can work with other test cases eg. without IMA/secure boot.  But if that
is not easy, maybe you can change the test script filename to something
like:  test_kexec_load_sigcheck.sh and test_kexec_file_load_sigcheck.sh 
then we can add other non-sigcheck related cases to other test scripts
later.  But ideally if we can handle them in current files it would be
better.

Another issue I noticed is even if boot with ima_appraise=off, kexec
load still checking the conditions. Will see if I'm having something
wrong in test steps.

Thanks
Dave
