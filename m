Hi Florian,

In v1, we backed up the IBT CPU state into the (user-accessible) signal
frame from FRED/XSAVE, then restored it:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20260517183024.16292-4-ripatel@wii.dev/

In v2, when entering the signal handler, the kernel just context switches
to the new user rip, bypassing IBT checks (continues executing if the
signal handler does not begin with endbr).

IBT stays enabled in both designs, just the IBT state is preserved in v1,
and lost in v2.

The same thing happens when doing a sigreturn in v2 (e.g. via trampoline),
again IBT is not enforced.  IBT stays enabled when doing a siglongjmp,
though.

Some time in the future, ideally:
- signal handler is *required* to start with endbr (this is easy)
- sigreturn as in my asm example enforces endbr after returning from a
  signal handler to a in-progres indirect branc
- libc (sig)longjmp is made IBT-compatible

Btw, I had self-tests for the v1 design, and {signal handle,rt_sigreturn,
siglongjmp} with {success case,violation} works flawlessly with Fedora 44
glibc amd64. With glibc i686 I ran into PLT issues, probably my fault.

It is quite surprised that siglongjmp was working, btw, since the glibc
longjmp code uses 'jmp *reg' (without notrack prefix). I guess you do an
endbr64 at the setjmp side?

Nice :-)
The alternative would have been to bolt on stuff to ARCH_SHSTK, or create
an entirely new arch_prctl. Open to any API.

Phew, I was hoping you'd say that.

If you want, I can sketch out glibc IBT enabling and test it on Debian
and Fedora, which IIRC already emit compile with -fcf-protection=branch
for all OS packages.

Only signal handlers, page faults don't reset IBT.

Just one concern I have is that people start relying on signal handlers
not requiring endbr64, and then a future kernel version breaking them once
we enforce it.

Really appreciate your review,
