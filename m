Let's say for argument's sake that we commit for a fully stable
backwards compatible ABI. Even then, you have to deal with multiple ABI
versions.

Live update's ABI is more complex compared to KVM's save/restore ABI.
For the KVM save/restore uAPI, you are largely describing architectural
state like CPU registers, etc. These things don't evolve as fast and
more or less stay the same.

Live update needs to describe the state of kernel objects. These are
more complex and evolve faster.

For example, say you merge guest_memfd preservation today. Some time
later, someone comes up with a more efficient data structure to track
the folios in the file. You _have_ to make a backwards-incompatible ABI
change to use this data structure.

Or say you add a new memory backend (like the HugeTLB patches in
flight). That likely will need a different ABI to describe the state of
the guest_memfd.

So you will end up with multiple ABI versions that aren't always
backwards compatible.

If you refuse that idea too, then KVM live update will be dead in the
water for a different reason. It will be damn near useless because it
can't keep up with an evolving subsystem.

Now once you get multiple ABI versions and you can seamlessly go from
old to new one, say you have a version that was superseded 5 years ago.
It would be completely reasonable to say that this version is old enough
and no one should be going from a 5 year old kernel to a modern one. So
you deprecate this ABI. Deprecating old unused uAPIs is not
unprecedented.

I think we are better off formalizing this deprecation period from the
get go.

A somewhat tangential example is BPF kfuncs. My BPF program that works
in kernel X might not work in kernel Y because the kfunc has changed or
been removed.

The argument they make in kfuncs.rst is that kfuncs "provide a kernel
<-> kernel API, and thus are not bound by any of the strict stability
restrictions associated with kernel <-> user UAPIs". For LUO as well,
this is a kernel -> kernel API. Users can also still do a regular kexec
or reboot. They just won't get the performance optimization of LUO.

Regardless of if you agree with the last bit about deprecating old
versions, ABIs evolving with the subsystem is a ground reality of live
update and it would be foolish to think we can do with only
backwards-compatible ABI changes forever.
