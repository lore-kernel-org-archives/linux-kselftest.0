Hmm. This will break any script that does echo foo >/dev/stdin too.

Just to throw an idea out there, what if the open were allowed if the file mode is sufficient or if the magic link target is openable with the correct mode without magic?  In other words, first check as in your code but without the exception and, if that check fails, then walk the same path that d_path would return and see if it would work as a normal open?  Of course, that second attempt would need to disable magic links to avoid recursing.  I’m not sure I love this idea...

Otherwise, I imagine we can live with the exception, especially if the new open API turns it off by default.
