It absolutely needs to move to common code.  Having arch code leads
to pointless (often unintentional) semantic difference between
architectures, and lots of boilerplate code.

Btw, can anyone of the arm crowd or Khalid comment on the linux-mm
thread on generic gup where I'm dealing with the pre-existing ADI
case of pointer untagging?
