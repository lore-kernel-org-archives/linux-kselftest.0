Subject: Re: [PATCH 0/2] fs: support $ORIGIN in ELF interpreter paths
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Hi, I am another Nix developer, and have participated in some LKML
discussions in the (recent and distant) past, and thought I should weigh
in here too.

Yes, the idea of making "relocatable software" is not a new one, and
indeed it is why `$ORIGIN` is supported in the RPATH etc. in the first
place.

Most of the programming model for writing relocatable software is fixed
at this point. For example, /proc/self/exe made it much easier to look
up arbitrary stuff relevant to the current executable. It is just some
initial entry point stuff (the ELF interpreter, and shebangs) which is a
glaring exception. Those should support `$ORIGIN` too. There is no good
technical justification (that I can think of) for some but not all of
these supporting `$ORIGIN` --- either it makes sense everywhere, or it
makes sense nowhere.

(I suspect the only reason it didn't happen was pure inertia/Conway's
law --- easier for whoever was excited about `$ORIGIN` to change the
glibc loader than the kernel.)

Yes, exactly. Traditionally people thought "eh `/lib/ld-linux.so.*`
doesn't change too much", and decided relocatable software that
nonetheless hard-coded that absolute path to an unknown system-provided
ELF interpreter was good enough. (Or if they weren't good enough, they
went with static linking, but that imposes other costs.)

Now there do exist purely-user-space work-arounds, like
https://github.com/Mic92/wrap-buddy, but they are quite complex, and
involve various patching trickery that is likely to scare a lot of
security analysis tools. A kernel-based solution that allows clean
declarative expression of intent with `$ORIGIN` is much more elegant.

I think it is good to see what Conda does as documented in
<https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/make-rel=
ocatable.html>
and consider why relying on namespaces vs good old-fashioned relocatable
isn't good enough for them either.

(I don't doubt that Conda would find this approach more robust than
their sedding tricks, and prefer to use it where possible.)

The short answer is while all of us in the build system space love
sandboxing during the build, we don't want that to lead to *requiring*
run time sandboxing of the built artifacts. For example, we can
certainly arrange sandboxing so `/lib/ld-linux.so.*` is the one that
some executable expects now, but every time that executable is run, it
*must* be run in a root filesystem where `/lib/ld-linux.so.*` is the
loader it expects.

If you have multiple programs that (for whatever reasons) expect
multiple different loaders, all spawning one another, it would
potentially incur quite the development cost to ensure that they all do
the proper unsharing to make everything work.

Relocatability recognizes that whether or not namespaces exist, in an
"open world" scenario where we don't know how the software we are
writing will be combined with other software for deployment downstream
in different ways, it is easiest to adopt an idiom where different
things can be placed at different absolute paths, at the user's
discretion, and so conflicts are always avoidable.

Waiting makes sense, I am curious too what he will have to say.
