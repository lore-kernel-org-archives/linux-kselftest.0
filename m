It's getting there, but it's all still very nascent.

Not using upstream code, though there are most definitely folks using guest_memfd
in production with out-of-tree patches.

But that's all beside the point.  What I'm saying is that SNP and TDX *must* use
guest_memfd, whereas guest_memfd is optional for all other VM types.  And so adding
LUO support for guest_memfd without even sketching out a plan for CoCo VMs feels
backwards.

I'm not necessarily opposed to gradual guest_memfd support, but there needs to be
a clear plan of how all of this is going to fit together.  It doesn't need to be
perfect, and I'm sure we'll make mistakes along the way, but I want to at least
try not to paint ourselves into a corner, especially with respect to the ABI.

It would list both "LIVE UPDATE" and "KERNEL VIRTUAL MACHINE (KVM)", as KVM would
still cover the files via "F:	virt/kvm/*".  And my read of MAINTAINERS is that
N: and K: entries are "secondary" if the files/scope is covered by an F: entry.

E.g. arch/x86/kvm/vmx/tdx.c is covered by "KERNEL VIRTUAL MACHINE FOR X86 (KVM/x86)"
via "F:	arch/x86/kvm/*/", and also by "X86 TRUST DOMAIN EXTENSIONS (TDX)" via
"N:	tdx" (or maybe "K:	\b(tdx)"?  I haven't bothered to check which one
triggers).  And while I don't think there was ever any formal discussion, AFAIK
everyone reads the situation as KVM still being the primary maintainer/tree for
that code.

> both of which is something you're saying you _don't_ want.

No, what I don't want is a dedicated "KVM LIVE UPDATE" entry, because I think most
people would read "F:     virt/kvm/kvm_luo.c" and "F:     virt/kvm/guest_memfd_luo.c"
as being more precise than KVM's "F:   virt/kvm/*" and thus would read things as
"KVM LIVE UPDATE" being the primary maintainer.

In other words, I'm more than ok with LUO being looped in on KVM LUO changes and
having the authority to object to problematic changes, but I'm not ok with LUO
taking primary ownership of KVM code.

I realize there's more than a bit of nuance in my interpretation of N: and K:,
but again my experience with TDX is that so long as the maintainers are aligned
on expectations, it's a non-issue in practice.

No, I understand exactly what ABI you're talking about.

Uh, yeah, so KVM has been managing such immutable ABI for practically its entire
existence.  KVM's save/restore uAPI has exactly what you're describing: serialization
ABI that needs to be backwards and forwards compatible between different kernels
in order to support both upgrade and rollback scenarios via live migration.

KVM also has immutable ABI between itself and guest kernels, including implicit
"ABI" in the form of not changing guest-visible behavior.

I don't entirely agree.  I get where you're coming from, and I 100% agree that
the more eyeballs on changes that may affect ABI, the better.

Where I have problems with the above is that it doesn't account for the nuances
of save/restore across different kernels.  The literal format of the serialized
data is the most obvious form of ABI, but it's absolutely possible to change ABI
without changing the data format.

E.g. say there's a flags field in some serialization structure, and flags X and Y
are mutually exclusive in current kernels.  If a future kernel relaxes that
restriction for whatever reason, then the effective ABI has been broken because
state created and saved on new kernels can't be restored on old kernels.  And
this is not a theoretical concern, KVM has run afoul of this a few times (though
thankfully very rarely).

I don't think it's reasonable to expect LUO maintainers to gain enough expertise
in each subsystem to be able to ensure changes are forwards and backwards
compatible.  The only way I see LUO being successful in the long term is to get
subsystem maintainers/contributors to understand *and buy-in* to the LUO model
and rules, so that each subsystem can largely be self-sustatining.  I.e. setting
yourselves up as literal gatekeepers will help prevent blatant breakage, but it's
less likely to help guard against more subtle breakage, and in my experience,
subtle breakage is by far harder to detect and more painful to deal with.

Somewhat of a side topic: in my experience, using monotonically increasing version
numbers is a horrible way to enumerate features/content.  So for me, allowing
KVM's LUO ABI to change with a verson bump is probably a non-starter.  I.e.
whatever gets merged needs to be more future-proof than "we'll deal with it later".
