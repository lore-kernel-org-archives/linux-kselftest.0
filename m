Right, but you may have some mount points that you don't want to cross
and others that it is perfectly fine to cross.
For example you might want to be able to cross into a 'tmp' filesystem.

I was thinking that the flags would never be removable.
A management process might have to flip its cwd back and forth
in order to clear the flags (opendir(".") should give a different
struct file).

This all gets tied up with the slight requirement for per-thread cwd.

I had another thought that the crudentials structure used for a file
lookup could also be taken from the cwd (not sure how it would
get there - especially if you need the correct group list).
That would allow a 'management' process to open a file in the context
of the target user process.
