The reason is I didn't add it was that test case went out of date and the
updated version of the test case went into the selftests in patch 2/2. I
thought that would suffice which covers all the cases. That's why I dropped
it.  Would that be Ok?

The changelog of the previous series had it because the selftest was added
only later.

Let me know, thanks,
