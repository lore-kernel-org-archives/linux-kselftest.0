I think Matthew was being a little sarcastic there ;) but I suppose it's
hinting at the fact they need to get a move on.

IMO - It's time for us to stop allowing filesystems to fail to implement what
mm requires of them, while still providing a hack to improve performance.

Really this hack shouldn't have been there in the first place, but it was a
'putting on notice' that filesystems need to support large folios, which
has been made amply clear to them for some time.

So yes there will be regressions for filesystems which _still_ do not
implement this, I'd suggest you focus on trying to convince them to do so
(or send patches :)

Yeah, again IMO - sorry, but tough.

This is something filesystems need to implement, if they fail to do so,
that's on them.
