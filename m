Thanks, I was kinda getting at this sort of thing, and I did think 'virtual page
offset' was a fairly common term of art, but as often with these things you go
and look to check later and realise that maybe it's not :P

I think overall it's probably easier to go to anon everywhere, I'll eyeball it
when done and make sure it's sane though!

Cheers, Lorenzo
