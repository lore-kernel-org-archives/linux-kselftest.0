Ok, so indeed the poll() loop complexifies the connection helpers
without much gain.

Ok, I'll give it a try with this simpler connect-only-extended-budget,
without the poll loop

Hmmm, I'm not very familiar with this mechanism, but aside from the
potential issues you are mentioning, wouldn't it make us loose a bit of
info here, when the watchdog kicks the runner out ? We may know from the
stacktrace that the subtest was in connect(), but we would loose any
formal error/errno on connection timeout I guess, and I am not sure how
confident we can get about any watchdog kick being a connect timeout.
