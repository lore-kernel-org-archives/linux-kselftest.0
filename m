Quoting Linus in [1]:

Honestly, I'd like to just encourage people to get the sparse update
from Luc Van Oostenryck instead.

For a while there it looked like Chris Li would just pull from Luc,
and we'd have timely releases, but that really doesn't seem to have
ended up happening after all. So right now it's probably just best to
get Luc's tree instead from

    https://github.com/lucvoo/sparse-dev

which also ends up fixing a lot of other issues.
