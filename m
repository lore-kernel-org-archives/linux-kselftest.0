Joel, I still can't understand why do we need tasklist... and I don't really
understand the comment. The code looks as if you are trying to avoid poll_wait(),
but this would be strange.

OK, why can't pidfd_poll() do

	poll_wait(file, &pid->wait_pidfd, pts);

	rcu_read_lock();
	task = pid_task(pid, PIDTYPE_PID);
	if (!task || task->exit_state && thread_group_empty(task))
		poll_flags = POLLIN | ...;
	rcu_read_unlock();

	return poll_flags;

?

Not really. If the task is traced, do_notify_parent() (and thus do_notify_pidfd())
can be called to notify the debugger even if the task is not a leader and/or if
it is not the last thread. The latter means a spurious wakeup for pidfd_poll().

Why get/put?

Oleg.
