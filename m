Hello Hari,


From the next time, please don't post a new version of a patch as a reply to
the previous version.  Post a new version as a new thread, with changelogs [1]
including links to previous revisions.

Also, give others sufficient time, say, one day, to add comments before posting
a new version.  If someone publicly asked questions to your patch, please
answer the questions and keep the discussion in public until the discussion is
clearly completed, before posting a new version.

Makes sense to me.  Thank you for this patch.

When you add changelog, please add links to the previous revisions.

Finally, please use mm-new [2] as the baseline of DAMON patches from the next
time.

This patch is applied to damon/next [2] tree.  If this patch is not added to
mm.git in short term (~1 week?), I will ask mm.git maintainer (Andrew Morton)
to pick this.  So, no action from your side is needed for now.  If it seems I
also forgot doing that or you cannot wait for my action, please feel free to
directly ask that to Andrew.
