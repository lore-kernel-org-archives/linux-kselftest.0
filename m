Oh I remember trying this years ago with a new seal, F_SEAL_WRITE_PEER,
or something like that.

The race condition between memfd_create and applying seals in fcntl?
I think it would be possible to block new write mappings from peer processes if
there is a new memfd_create api that accepts seals. Allowing caller to
set a seal
like the one I proposed years ago, though in a race-free manner. Then
also consider
how to properly handle blocking inherited +W mapping through
clone/fork. Maybe I'm
forgetting some other pitfalls?

IMO the best solution would handle the issue at memfd creation time by
removing the race condition.
