I don't have a meaningful performance number yet. My current 
understanding is that the main value of the series is more about 
architectural completeness and enabling the Hyper-V L1 use case than 
about a direct performance win.

The practical issue that triggered this is Hyper-V as L1 in Hyper-V 
appears to require DecodeAssists before enabling nested SVM for L2, so 
the visible benefit is enabling that nested virtualization 
configuration. Without exposing DecodeAssists to L1 Hyper-V, the nested 
svm cases like this (L0 KVM + L1 Hyper-V + L2 KVM) would be broken, 
because the Hyper-V doesn't think the platform have the nested 
virtualization capability, although the hardware supports it.

I agree that fully virtualizing DecodeAssists is not straightforward, 
and the complexity needs to be justified.  My intent is to keep the 
implementation biased toward propagating already-available decode state: 
hardware VMCB02 bytes for hardware exits, emulator-provided bytes for 
synthesized exits when available, and only using an on-demand fetch as a 
fallback where no decoded state is available.

Thanks,
Tina
