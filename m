Overall I support this effort.  In my quick skim this code looked good.

My feeling is that we need to be able to support running ntpd and
support one namespace doing googles smoothing of leap seconds while
another namespace takes the leap second.

What I was imagining when I was last thinking about this was one
instance of struct timekeeper aka tk_core per time namespace.  That
structure already keeps offsets for all of the various clocks from
the kerne internal time sources.  What would be needed would be to
pass in an appropriate time namespace pointer.

I could be completely wrong as I have not take the time to completely
trace through the code.  Have you looked at pushing the time namespace
down as far as tk_core?

What I think would be the big advantage (besides ntp working) is that
the bulk of the code could be reused.  Allowing testing of the kernel's
time code by setting up a new time namespace.  So a person in production
could setup a time namespace with the time set ahead a little  bit and
be able to verify that the kernel handles the upcoming leap second
properly.



I don't know about the vfs.  I think the danger is being able to write
dates in the future or in the past.  It appears that utimes(2) and
utimesnat(2) already allow this except for status change.  So it is
possible we simply don't care.  I seem to remember that what nfs does
is take the time stamp from the host writing to the file.

I think the guide for filesystem timestamps should be to first ensure
we don't introduce security issues, and then do what distributed
filesystems do when dealing with hosts with different clocks.

Given those those two guidlines above I don't think there is a need to
change timestamsp the way the user namespace changes uid when displayed.



As for the hardware like the real time clock we definitely should not
let a root in a time namespace change it.  We might even be able to get
away with leaving the real time clock out of the time namespace.  If not
we need to be very careful how the real time clock is abstracted.  I
would start by leaving the real time clock hardware out of the time
namespace and see if there is any part of userspace that cares.
