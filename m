Yes agreed :)

Yeah and obviously once scalable CoW is in even that name will be wrong :)

I think the semantics are a non-obvious but I do like that we are explicit in
saying 'is a CoW mapping'. We just maybe need to be more consistent with that.

Maybe once scalable CoW is in can work to improve consistency of that...

Cool will make the changes as above then! :)

Yeah indeed, it's just amusing to think about, but in practice makes perfect
sense.

Though honestly I wish we didn't remove VMA_SHARED_BIT in this situation and
then rely on the hugely-confusingly-named VMA_MAY_SHARE_BIT for stuff where we
_really_ need to figure out whether it was mapped shared.

But that's another thing :)
