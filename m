With my maintainer hat on, the above statement leads me to think this
new ABI is work in progress, so not yet suitable for upstream.

Also, how is user space supposed to know that it can now pass tagged
pointers into the kernel? An ABI change (or relaxation), needs to be
advertised by the kernel, usually via a new HWCAP bit (e.g. HWCAP_TBI).
Once we have a HWCAP bit in place, we need to be pretty clear about
which syscalls can and cannot cope with tagged pointers. The "as of now"
implies potential further relaxation which, again, would need to be
advertised to user in some (additional) way.

While the kernel currently supports this in some way (by clearing the
tag exception entry, el0_da), the above implies (at least to me) that
sigcontext.fault_address would contain the tagged address. That's not
the case (unless I missed it in your patches).

I think we need to be more precise here...

...and probably a full list here.
