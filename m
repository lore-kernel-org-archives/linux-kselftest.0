What about x86 CoCo VMs?  Which are quite literally _the_ reason guest_memfd was
created in the first place.

Or to word it another way, one _can_ save guest_memfd, it's just slower.  My
point is that this series needs to provide a _lot_ more information about the
bigger KVM picture.  For those of us that are on the very fringes of live update,
it's practically impossible to review because, to us, it seems very arbitrary.

The part that's especially confusing is the saving of the VM type.  That comes
straight from userspace, so it's super bizarre to automatically save/restore that,
but nothing else.

Why not simply add a file pattern match to the LIVE UPDATE entry?

Which is amusing to me because that implies KVM does not, and I would hazard to
guess that KVM has the biggest ABI surface of any subsystem in the kernel by a
country mile (though I'm probably wildly underestimating the effective ABI surface
of filesystems).

Meh, "Don't break userspace" is a universal rule in the kernel, I genuinely don't
see why liveupdate needs special treatment.

Perhaps in the short term, but IMO, that's not a winning strategy in the long
term.  From my perspective, that like saying the PAGE CACHE maintainers should
review every usage of the filemap APIs, because how the APIs are used impacts
the page cache and affects userspace-visible behavior.  There are myriad analogies
like that throughout the kernel.

Yes, liveupdate is new and shiny, but IMO for it to be successful and maintainable,
it needs to be treated like any other core infrastructure in the kernel, not a
special snowflake whose details are known only by a handful of people.  Because
I think it's likely liveupdate goes one of two ways: either liveupdate becomes a
very niche thing that is used sparingly throughout the kernel, or it becomes a
broadly used feature that is supported by many filesystems and subsystems.

If liveupdate is relegated to niche status, then it probably isn't going to see
a significant amount of ongoing development, at which point the folks working on
liveupdate will naturally migrate to other projects, and maintenance will largely
be left to subsystem maintainers.

If liveupdate is broadly used, then having a single group of people maintain
every subsystem's usage won't scale, and maintenance will again largely fall on
the shoulder of subsystem maintainers.  Which is totally fine and working as
intended, because that's exactly what subystem maintainers are signing up for
by merging support for liveupdate.
