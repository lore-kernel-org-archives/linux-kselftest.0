[ Note: I've spoken with both Mark Rutland and James Morse both of whom
  might potentially have some overlapping changes, they've both agreed
  that they'll deal with any rebasing if it's a question of this getting
  in or something else. ]

I've removed the RFC tag from this version of the series, but the items
that I'm looking for feedback on remains the same:

 - The userspace ABI, in particular:
  - The vector length used for the SVE registers, access to the SVE
    registers and access to ZA and (if available) ZT0 depending on
    the current state of PSTATE.{SM,ZA}.
  - The use of a single finalisation for both SVE and SME.
  - There was some review from the qemu people who seemed OK with the
    structure, and there's some initial patches from them at:
       https://patchew.org/QEMU/20260216034432.23912-1-richard.henderson@linaro.org/

This series implements support for SME use in non-protected KVM guests.
Much of this is very similar to SVE, the main additional challenge that
SME presents is that it introduces a new vector length similar to the
SVE vector length and two new controls which change the registers seen
by guests:

 - PSTATE.ZA enables the ZA matrix register and, if SME2 is supported,
   the ZT0 LUT register.
 - PSTATE.SM enables streaming mode, a new floating point mode which
   uses the SVE register set with the separately configured SME vector
   length.  In streaming mode implementation of the FFR register is
   optional.

It is also permitted to build systems which support SME without SVE, in
this case when not in streaming mode no SVE registers or instructions
are available.  Further, there is no requirement that there be any
overlap in the set of vector lengths supported by SVE and SME in a
system, this is expected to be a common situation in practical systems.

Since there is a new vector length to configure we introduce a new
feature parallel to the existing SVE one with a new pseudo register for
the streaming mode vector length.  Due to the overlap with SVE caused by
streaming mode rather than finalising SME as a separate feature we use
the existing SVE finalisation to also finalise SME, a new define
KVM_ARM_VCPU_VEC is provided to help make user code clearer.  Finalising
SVE and SME separately would introduce complication with register access
since finalising SVE makes the SVE registers writeable by userspace and
doing multiple finalisations results in an error being reported.
Dealing with a state where the SVE registers are writeable due to one of
SVE or SME being finalised but may have their VL changed by the other
being finalised seems like needless complexity with minimal practical
utility, it seems clearer to just express directly that only one
finalisation can be done in the ABI.

Access to the floating point registers follows the architecture:

 - When both SVE and SME are present:
   - If PSTATE.SM == 0 the vector length used for the Z and P registers
     is the SVE vector length.
   - If PSTATE.SM == 1 the vector length used for the Z and P registers
     is the SME vector length.
 - If only SME is present:
   - If PSTATE.SM == 0 the Z and P registers are inaccessible and the
     floating point state accessed via the encodings for the V registers.
   - If PSTATE.SM == 1 the vector length used for the Z and P registers
 - The SME specific ZA and ZT0 registers are only accessible if SVCR.ZA is 1.

The VMM must understand this, in particular when loading state SVCR
should be configured before other state.  It should be noted that while
the architecture refers to PSTATE.SM and PSTATE.ZA these PSTATE bits are
not preserved in SPSR_ELx, they are only accessible via SVCR.

There are a large number of subfeatures for SME, most of which only
offer additional instructions but some of which (SME2 and FA64) add
architectural state. These are configured via the ID registers as per
usual.

Protected KVM is supported, with the implementation maintaining the
existing restriction that the hypervisor will refuse to run if streaming
mode or ZA is enabled.  This both simplfies the code and avoids the need
to allocate storage for host ZA and ZT0 state, there seems to be little
practical use case for supporting this and the memory usage would be
non-trivial.  SME is not made available to protected guests, only normal
guests.

The new KVM_ARM_VCPU_VEC feature and ZA and ZT0 registers have not been
added to the get-reg-list selftest, the idea of supporting additional
features there without restructuring the program to generate all
possible feature combinations has been rejected.  I will post a separate
series which does that restructuring.

There is some room for optimisation here, for example we could do more
work to suppress isb()s on SMCR changes (we don't really try in the
hypervisor), but this is already a very large series.
