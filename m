I don't know if periodically is a proper characterization.  There may be
a code path that does that.  But from what I can see timekeeping_update
is the guts of settimeofday (and a few related functions).

So it appears to make sense for timekeeping_update to be per namespace.

Hmm.  Looking at what is updated in the vsyscall_gtod_data it does
look like you would have to periodically update things, but I don't know
big that period would be.  As long as the period is reasonably large,
or the time namespaces were sufficiently deschronized it should not
be a problem.  But that is the class of problem that could make
my ideal impractical if there is measuarable overhead.

Where were you seeing timekeeping_update being called periodically?

Yes.  But you don't have to have introduce another variable just make
certain vsyscall_gtod_data is a page aligned thing per time namespace.

If I read the summary of the existing patchset something very similiar
is already going on.

Each process would only map one.  And unshare of the time namespace
would need to act like the pid namespace or be limited to only being
allowed when there is only a single task using the mm.
