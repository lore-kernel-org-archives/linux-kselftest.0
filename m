That's great, thanks. I think this should cover casting pointers to any
integer types, not just "unsigned long" (e.g. long long).

The only downside is that with this patchset the untagging can be done
after the conversion to ulong (get_user_pages()) as that's where the
problem was noticed. With a new sparse feature, we'd have to annotate
the conversion sites (not sure how many until we run the tool though).

I agree. That's what the kernel uses in functions like get_user_pages()
which take ulong as an argument. Similarly mmap() and friends don't
expect the pointer to be dereferenced, hence the ulong argument. The
interesting part that the man page (and the C library header
declaration) shows such address argument as void *. We could add a
syscall wrapper in the arch code, only that it doesn't feel consistent
with the "rule" that ulong addresses are not actually tagged pointers.
