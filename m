Hey Omar,

Good to hear from you.

I think the coredump_filter solution is just the wrong approach. It is
a hack and in a part of coredumping that is riddled with bolted on hacks
already.

And I don't think the argument that changing this in userspace is
somehow not possible holds. It not being wanted is another thing.

This is a new feature and as such it is our responsibility to expose it
in a way that is correct, maintainable, and clean. I don't think that
this is possible in the usermodehelper case without doing really hacky
things.

Plus, I really want usermodehelpers to go away. It really is a CVE
machine. Most of the ~40 CVEs in the last 10+ years have been in the
handlers. Mainly because the interface is really not nice and prone to
security issues. They are spawned from a kthread with kernel level
privileges that userspace then needs to drop. So really, changing
userspace is a long-term self-service. :)

And yes, there doesn't have to be anything long-running. They can just
be socket activated.

The pull request that's up against systemd splits this out into
systemd-coredump though. So PID 1 itself can also be coredumped. That
daemon is long-running but it's only job is to spawn workers on incoming
connections and maintain backpressure. The listen fd is in the fdstore
and so survives restarts.

We could add COREDUMP_TRAILING_ZERO or whatever so you get that
truncated behavior over the socket from the earlier patch. While that
will get rid of smuggling non-memory type bits into the filter and
won't have the fork/exec inheritance bugs that the other patch has it
still has other issues.

It will always have to accept an O(hole / PAGE_SIZE) walk under the mmap
write lock before ever writing a coredump. So a JVM starting with a 64
gb heap reservation or a go program with a large reservation means
millions of probes before the dump even starts. The selftest in this
series dumpds with 256 MB. That amounts to 65536 probes. This seems just
wrong when we know the holes when we emit the dump.

For default 8 mb pthread stacks that are in a single anon vma 4 × 8 mb =
32 mb == 8196 pages only 8 of the 8196 pages are resident. Most stacks
grow down and glibc parks the tcb at the top. That in turn means every
hole in a stack is a leading hole. The trailing zero hack cannot handle
that at all wasting a bunch of space.

For the blob storage thing you can just upload the header last. So
stream the data as the records arrive and compute the corrected phdr
table at the end. If you're using a temporary file or whatever it
becomes even easier to rewrite the header.
