Thank you for sharing your detailed setup.  It is helpful.  Btw, have you
considered using intervals auto-tuning [1]?

Thank you for clarifying the motivation of this series.

To me, it's still unclear what is the real user impact, though.  I mean, I can
understand DAMON suddenly reporting more hot memory can surprise some people.
But, why that matters in what extent for your use case?  You may not run DAMON
on your system only to read the information.  You may run it to do something
beneficial using the information.  What is that, and how badly degraded DAMON's
monitoring results affect it?

Overall, unless the real impact is serious, splitting huge pages only for
better DAMON monitoring sounds like not a good tradeoff.  You will increase
DAMON overhead and lose THP benefits in some extent.

Once it is added to the kernel, we have to support it for long term.  Let's not
introduce something for only temporal use.

Thank you for good opinion, Zi.  I agree all the points.  That said, I still
want to understand the problem first.

Yes, the behavior is real and I agree your theory of how it happens.  I don't
clearly understand if it is really bad in what situations, though.

Only after understanding what is the problem and how bad it is, we will be able
to think of different approaches and assess those.  To me, it is still unclear
what is the real problem and how bad it is.  I will wait for your further
clarifications of those.
