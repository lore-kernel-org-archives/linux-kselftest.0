Ok, we are on the same page on this.

Agreed. In my pseudo-code above, I meant removal from waitqueue only once we
are not going to be blocking in poll and returning to userspace. I may have
messed the sequence of events, but my point was to show the race I had in
mind (missing a wake up due to adding to the waitqueue too late inside
pidfd_poll()).  Anyway, I will repost with your suggested change and send it
soon. Thanks for the discussions.

thanks,
