All of this is unnecessary text. You don't need to explain the patches here and
then again in their commit messages. Please remove this explanation.

Also don't need to give history. Just explain why you want to add memcg reclaim
kfunc and what use-cases you are looking into. (Ask your AI to be very concise
and precise).
