I have been thinking a bit lately on how to address the problem of user tagged pointers passed to the kernel through syscalls, and IMHO probably the best way we have to catch them all and make sure that the approach is maintainable in the long term is to introduce shims that tag/untag the pointers passed to the kernel.

In details, what I am proposing can live either in userspace (preferred solution so that we do not have to relax the ABI) or in kernel space and can be summarized as follows:
 - A shim is specific to a syscall and is called by the libc when it needs to invoke the respective syscall.
 - It is required only if the syscall accepts pointers.
 - It saves the tags of a pointers passed to the syscall in memory (same approach if the we are passing a struct that contains pointers to the kernel, with the difference that all the tags of the pointers in the struct need to be saved singularly)
 - Untags the pointers
 - Invokes the syscall
 - Retags the pointers with the tags stored in memory
 - Returns

What do you think?
