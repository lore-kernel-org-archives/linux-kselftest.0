The situation is a bit more complicated.  There are many programs out
there which use malloc and free (at least indirectly) after a fork,
and we cannot break them.  In glibc, we have a couple of subsystems
which are put into a known state before calling the fork/clone system
call if the application calls fork.  The price we pay for that is a
fork which is not POSIX-compliant because it is not async-signal-safe.
Admittedly, other libcs chose different trade-offs.

However, what is the same across libcs is this: You cannot call the
clone system call directly and get a fully working new process.  Some
things break.  For example, for recursive mutexes, we need to know the
TID of the current thread, and we cannot perform a system call to get
it for performance reasons.  So everyone has a TID cache for that.
But the TID cache does not get reset when you bypass the fork
implementation in libc, so you end up with subtle corruption bugs on
TID reuse.

So I'd say that in most cases, the C situation is pretty much the same
as the Go situation.  If I recall correctly, the problem for Go is
that it cannot call setns from Go code because it fails in the kernel
for multi-threaded processes, and Go processes are already
multi-threaded when user Go code runs.
