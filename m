reading through the bug report, you mention that the following
"The application may not be able to save and restore the protection bits
for all keys because the kernel API does not actually specify that the
set of keys is a small, fixed set."

What exact kernel API do you need? This patch set exposes the total
number of keys and  max keys,  through sysfs.

Is this sufficient? or do you need something else?
