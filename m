Hi Richard,

Thank you for the read.

Just a heads up, this was based on mm-new because of some recent work
on Brendan's page_alloc.h cleanup, but if you managed to get it applied
then maybe that's made its way forward already.

CXL protocols simply state how to do the memory transaction at a
physical / transport level.  It does not make any statement on how the
operating systems are to make sense of these devices or what constructs
/ abstractions to build to actually manage the devices themselves.

This series is not necessarily attached to CXL in particular, you could
just as easily carve out memory from the general pool onto a private
node to ensure it only gets used for a particular use.

In fact, that is how I have been testing this with dax/kmem:
https://github.com/gourryinverse/linux/commit/f279e741d9c3643597525bfab916b29b95cb635b

> 

The NUMA abstraction representing topology/locality is a construct we
(the OS developers) have decided on historically - but there's nothing
that dictates we can never create new useful abstractions with it.

Consider:
    N_NORMAL_MEMORY,        /* The node has regular memory */
    N_HIGH_MEMORY,          /* The node has regular or high memory */

These have nothing to do with topology or locality, they are node states
that only have meaning in the context of linux mm/.


To make something clear - there is no *requirement* for any particular
device to use this abstraction.  It simply enables a cleaner way for
devices carrying memory to re-utilize mm/ services while ensuring their
memory does not silently get used under system pressure (or some vagrant
in userspace doing `numactl --interleave all`).

Ignoring all the CAP bits entirely, if you just took the base series
your driver could re-use the buddy allocator without any special logic
AND have confidence that your driver is the only possible user of that
memory (barring some truly obscene bug).

First let me say that there's nothing that prevents us from doing this,
and we *could* make this the default case - but this decision was
intentional by me.

Having them all present in each-other's zonelists by default creates a
number of implicit opt-ins that are unclear:

  - any direct zonelist iterator now iterates all zones on all private
    nodes, even those nodes do not opt into the same services

    e.g. zonelist iteration in reclaim that targets Private Node A would
    attempt to reclaim Private Node B as well.  That would require and
    extra explicit filter.

    I ask: Why do this? Just isolate in the zonelist, and if there is
           a desire for intersections - make it explicit, not implicit.

  - fallback allocations can now occur across private nodes, even
    if those nodes are intended for different purposes.

    Obviously you can use nodemask to tighten the allocation target, but
    I use `numactl --interleave --all` as an example of a clear case
    where intersected nodelists may not give you the behavior you want.


So for consistency - everything including zonelists have full isolation.
This way all interactions with a private node must be explicit - always.


This is actually one of the problems with ZONE_DEVICE - and you can see
it in this patch set.  Some of the hooks in mm/ for zone_device only
apply to PTE cases, and are absent from PMD cases - only because PMD
mappings in ZONE_DEVICE aren't supported.

That kind of implicit behavior is quite bad.

That said, future improvements could include something like:

for_reclaimable_zone(ZONELIST_PRIVATE) {}

where we loosen this isolation, and formalize a filter, but I would
like to see the usecase for it first.  Loosening the isolation defeats
the entire purpose of the series, so there should be a strong reason to
do so.

Yes.

I'm not sure i follow this question, can you help me understand?

If by protocol you mean the CAP bits (opting into reclaim, demotion,
etc), then yes.  If you mean something else (CXL) then I think that's
orthogonal and unrelated.

Sure, I can expand on it.  I think it's not as much to add as you think
though - it's simply adding the concept of isolation to a NUMA node.

Some more explanation below, but if you think there is something i
should explicit spell out in v6 cover, please let me know.

---

I agree that NUMA as a concept was best-effort for, comically enough,
somewhat *Uniform* memory access - instead of *Non*-Uniform memory access.

The current abstraction quite nicely handles the case where all memory
on the system is roughly of the same calibre (DDR4, DDR5, etc) and
roughly for the same purpose (general system memory).

But it is quite incapable of handling truly heterogeneous memory systems
(precious HBM attached to the CPU, GPU's with HBM over a coherent link,
hardware-compressed memory expansion, network devices w/ memory, etc).

If you look at the history of ZONE_DEVICE, what it fundamentally does is
slaps an isolation mechanism on top of NUMA nodes because the NUMA
abstraction doesn't provide one. 

The problem with that approach is now you have to reason about a node
having both fungible and non-fungible memory.  It creates the need for
something like migrate_device.c when a properly isolated NUMA node could
just use migrate.c directly (with a coherent link).


One example of what isolation on the node enables:

A Private Node can hotplug memory in ZONE_NORMAL - which means it
can be GUP pinned.  That means driver support for GPU direct storage
is simply `alloc_pages_node() + pin()`. The driver doesn't have to
worry about something like SLAB accidentally using that same memory.

All without having to rewrite a bunch of mm/ in a driver, and with
having to do some kind of heroics with ZONE_DEVICE that causes even
more special mm/ interactions.

That only comes from adding an isolation primitive to a NUMA node.

We re-use (combine) existing filters where possible.

We add new ones where ZONE_DEVICE did not implement filters due to some
*implicit* filter already existing.

Two clear examples:
   - reclaim does not target ZONE_DEVICE
   - ZONE_DEVICE does not support PMD

Both cases result in private-node filters that otherwise would have to
exist for ZONE_DEVICE (and if ZONE_DEVICE ever grows PMD support, those
filters will have to be added).

Of course, and thank you for reading.

If nothing else I hope this series helps folks understand the page
allocator better (it certainly has helped me).  If there is anything
you think I can improve or better explain, I am happy to discuss.

I am planning a larger publication of all my research sometime in the
future, but I think code is more impactful and useful - so I am
prioritizing that for now :].
