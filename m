Oh, the semantics for this changed in this patchset, hah. I was still on
vacation so didn't get to look at it before it was sent out. From prior
discussion I remember that the original intention actual was what you
argue for. And the patchset should be as tight as possible. Having
special cases where ".." is allowed just sounds like an invitation for
userspace to get it wrong.
Aleksa, did you have a specific use-case in mind that made you change
this or was it already present in an earlier iteration of the patchset
by someone else?
