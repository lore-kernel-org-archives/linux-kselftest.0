The current patchset handles majority of pointers in a just a few
common places, like copy_from_user. Userspace shims will need to untag
& retag all pointer arguments - we are looking at hundreds if not
thousands of shims. They will also be located in a different code base
from the syscall / ioctl implementations, which would make them
impossible to keep up to date.
