No, I dont prefer to make any assumption and try to make both the series
independent of each other. Landing any of the series first should not
break another. I am keeping this goal.

For this series, I am strictly focusing on fully shared guest_memfd. And
any guest_memfd that supports or will support conversion to private will
not be allowed for preservation with this series.

Freezing the conversion, is requirement for guest_memfd that will
support private mapping. At this point I dont want to include this in
this base support. We will look on this when we will work on
preservation of private mapping.

yes, Also
We will never know if everything is converted to shared unless we walk
the maple tree, But for this base support, we dont want to depend on
conversion series, So depending on INIT_SHARED flag along with
kvm_arch_has_private_mem check makes this series immune to conversion series,
INIT_SHARED makes the initial mapping shared, and
kvm_arch_has_private_mem avoid any further conversion which is also true
before and after conversion series.

WDYT? V2 does not have INIT_SHARED check, it has only
kvm_arch_has_private_mem. I can comment there to be updated in next
version, if we are aligned on this.

Thanks.
