You may need to allow absolute paths that refer to items inside
the controlled area.
(Even if done by a textual replacement based on the expected name
of the base directory.)

You might want a mountpoint flag that allows crossing into the mounted
filesystem (you may need to get out in order to do pwd()).

Or 'fix' the /proc/$pid/fd/$fd code to open the actual vnode rather than
being a symlink (although this might still let you get a directory vnode).
FWIW this is what NetBSD does - you can link the open file back into
the filesystem!

What about allowing 'trivial' symlinks?

If you make the flags a property of the directory vnode (perhaps as
well as any syscall flags), and make it inherited by vnode lookup then
it can be used to stop library functions (or entire binaries) using
blocked paths.
You'd then only need to add an fcntl() call to set the flags (but never
clear them) to get the restriction applied to every lookup.
