Side note: I do think that while the above is correct, the rest of the
patch shows that we might be better off simply not havign the warning
for address space changes at all for the "cast a pointer to an integer
type" case.

When you cast to a non-pointer type, the address space issue simply
doesn't exist at all, so the warning makes less sense.

It's really just he "pointer to one address space" being cast to
"pointer to another address space" that should really warn, and that
might need that "__force" thing.

Hmm? So maybe a sparse change is better for most of that patch.
