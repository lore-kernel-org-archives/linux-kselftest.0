I think as well that we should make explicit the information that
__force is hiding.
A possible solution could be defining some new address spaces and use
them where it is relevant in the kernel. Something like:

# define __compat_ptr __attribute__((noderef, address_space(5)))
# define __tagged_ptr __attribute__((noderef, address_space(6)))

In this way sparse can still identify the casting and trigger a warning.

We could at that point modify sparse to ignore these conversions when a
specific flag is passed (i.e. -Wignore-compat-ptr, -Wignore-tagged-ptr)
to exclude from the generated warnings the ones we have already dealt
with.

What do you think about this approach?
