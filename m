I don't know much about the history but I thought these days guest_memfd
is used for more than just encrypted memory. I have seen talk of it
being used for non-confidential VMs. For example these patches [0][1][2].

The CoCo parts can follow, but IIUC guest_memfd is being used to back
guest memory on non-CoCo VMs too.

Sure. But making things faster is the entire point of live update.

Guest memory is one piece of that puzzle. Devices are another, and
that's why there is a lot of work going on with VFIO, PCI, and IOMMU
preservation. vCPUs are also a piece, but I think those will be the
hardest to live update.

That's valid criticism. This series should do a better job of laying out
the high level plan and where things fit.

This would list us as maintainers of kvm_luo.c and the tree as
liveupdate.git, both of which is something you're saying you _don't_
want.

No, it doesn't. What I'm saying is I care about changes to the _live
update ABI_. Just like you probably care about changes to KVM ABI but
not so much about BPF for example.

Ironically enough, you miss my point. I'm not talking about userspace
ABI. We all know not to break that. I am talking about live update
_serialization ABI_. See the stuff under include/linux/kho/abi. This
series also adds things there.

This is ABI between kernels. It needs to be stable-ish so you can move
from one kernel version to another. At the same time, unlike userspace
ABI, it can change. Today we don't have any rules and let you change
things freely as long as you do a version bump. But at a later point,
the plan is to add some stability requirements to the ABI so you can
actually upgrade the kernel across major versions.

So at least for ABI changes, there should be an explicit ACK from the
live update group. For code changes, I'd be flexible if you'd prefer
that. More on it below.

I've heard kernel maintainers complain many times about people or
companies throwing code over the wall and not staying around to deal
with the mess it might make.

I'd like to avoid that with live update and help you maintain this. As
you've said, you are not as familiar with live update, and perhaps you
might not even be as interested in it. So why not let the people who are
help review the code?

Ultimately it is your subsystem so it is your call. And as I've said
before, if you want to take it through the KVM tree and have a veto I
think that is perfectly fine.

As an alternate example, with memfd_luo, the MM folks are rarely
involved and the maintenance and review is done largely by me because I
wrote that code. Mainly because the contents in memfd_luo.c are all live
update related and don't matter much to core MM or memfd. I have heard
similar desire for the HugeTLB live update work I am doing.

We can figure out what works best for KVM.
