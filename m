Why?  It's not like the performance of this code matters terribly.

Regardless, nothing *requires* a test to go down that route.  As I said before,
my goal with the selftests infrastructure is to effectively optimize the entire
experience, i.e. to provide default behavior that works well for the majority of
tests.  Attempting to provide default behavior that perfectly fits *every* test
is simply impossible.

No, because vCPU state would be encrypted at that point.  Moving vm_sev_launch()
would also break test_sev_dbg(), which sets a global buffer to all 0xaa prior to
encrypting that data.

That's literally why the function exists though.  The one and only existing
implementation (on arm64) uses it to initialize the vGIC.

  void kvm_arch_vm_finalize_vcpus(struct kvm_vm *vm)
  {
	if (vm->arch.has_gic)
		__vgic_v3_init(vm->arch.gic_fd);
  }

That's *very* similar to the proposed TDX usage, where some per-VM asset(s) can
be initialized/frozen only after all vCPUs have been added.  In other words, the
name is describing where in the VM creation/setup flow the hook is called, and
perhaps more importantly, the impact of the call: vCPUs are finalized (obviously
with a different definition of "finalized" based on the VM properties).

We can't have our cake and eat it too.  Either we launch/finalize SEV/TDX VMs as
part of the common VM creation flows (as proposed for TDX), or we force tests to
manually launch/finalize the VM after additional setup.  The only way to have it
both ways is to utilize crazy macro shenanigans to execute arbitrary code between
creating the VM and launching/finalizing the VM, and even I would balk at that.

I honestly don't see any reason to try to figure out which of the two approaches
is optimal at this time.  Whatever decision we make isn't set in stone, and in
fact should be relative easy to change.  And without being able to see all the
TDX/SEV tests that are waiting in the wings, it's more or less impossible to make
an informed decision.

I definitely want to have SEV and TDX use the same core approach in the end, but
I don't think we should force the issue right now, because the cost of reworking
the SEV and/or TDX infrastructure when there are only a bare handful of tests is
so low.  It will cost more to try to predict the future of a 50/50 outcome than
it will to make a completely wild guess between the two options and rework things
if we guess wrong.

Uh, every selftest that uses global variables to communicate between guest and
host?

Yes, but that's completely orthogonal to all of this.

Key word "seems".  I'm pretty sure Oliver picked kvm_arch_vm_finalize_vcpus() as
the name in commit 8911c7dbc607 ("KVM: arm64: selftests: Create a VGICv3 for
'default' VMs") for the same reasons I think it's a good fit for coco VMs: like
finalizing TDX VMs, initializing the vGIC effectively finalizes vCPUs.

We could rename it to kvm_arch_vm_finalize(), but that won't change the fact that
we'll need to decide between automagic vs. manual finalization, and it definitely
should be a separate discussion.

Only if __shared is a hard requirement for base TDX support, which I assume is
not the case.
