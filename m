Actually, no, I've dug into this and we *do* need the devfn here but
it's needlessly confusing. We should not be using PCI_DEVID() as we
aren't actually representing a DEVID in this case...

According to the Intel VT-D spec, when using SVT_VERIFY_BUS, the MSB of
the SID field represents the starting bus number and the LSB represents
the end bus number. The requester id's bus number must then be within
that range. The PCI_DEVID macro matches these semantics if you assume
the devfn is the end bus, but doesn't really make sense here and just
confuses the issue.

So the code was correct, I'll just try to clean it up to make it less
confusing.

Thanks,

Logan
