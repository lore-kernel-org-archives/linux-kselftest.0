I also enjoy hacking over my vacation. I'm often told to take break but
some of the best ideas come when on vacation :)

Is relying on brpm->buf enough?
Right now that's only 256 bytes I think, which is not enough to read
segments we might care about. That worked fine when it was just a magic
number but the idea with the eBPF program is to make decisions based on
more data.

In the selftest I provided, the `PT_INTERP` segment is already at file
offset 0x318 (792). I was imaginging NixOS having to support
`PT_INTERP_NIX` in order for the produced binaries to be backwards
compatible with older kernels.

The other idea would be to make the `match()` broad and select
everything but then nearly all ELF64 binaries would match and then pay
the price to `load()` and ultimately `-ENOEXEC`. Seems like it would
make multiple BPF binfmt programs less useful.

I don't mind at all you sending v3 and in fact I've been enjoying your
involvement. I didn't know what to expect when I offered this idea up to
the community.=20

I'm happy to keep co-developing this with you within a design you feel
acceptable with. Please let me know how I can remain engaged and
helpful.

One last thing I was thinking about is that we will also need to support
$ORIGIN in the shebang path, however I just tested it and this current broa=
d
BPF solution can largely handle it [1], with a small wrinkle.

  $ printf '#!$ORIGIN/interp\n' > /opt/app/greet
  $ cp ./interp /opt/app/interp     # any interpreter/loader
  $ chmod +x /opt/app/greet /opt/app/interp

  # stock kernel: binfmt_script opens the literal "$ORIGIN/interp"
  $ /opt/app/greet
  bash: /opt/app/greet: $ORIGIN/interp: bad interpreter: No such file or di=
rectory

  # with the handler registered, $ORIGIN resolves to the script's dir
  $ bpftool struct_ops register shebang_origin.bpf.o /sys/fs/bpf
  $ echo ':shebang-origin:B:shebang_origin::::' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/=
register
  $ /opt/app/greet
  <runs /opt/app/interp, the loader found next to the script>

The wrinkle is that it can't express today is the single optional argument.
(i.e. `#!interp arg" -> argv[1]=3Darg`). We might ned a way to express
that in the load.

Anywyas, thanks again. All your ideas made sense modulo I'm unsure if
`bprm->buf` is enough to make a decision...
