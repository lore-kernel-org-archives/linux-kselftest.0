OK, I think we can just say "The kernel supports tags in:" here. Will do in v8.

How exactly should I do that? Something like this [1]? Or is it only
for hardware specific things and for this patchset I need to do

I'll update the doc to reflect this in v8.

In what way?

Will add a full list in v8.
