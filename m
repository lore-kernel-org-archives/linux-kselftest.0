You were warned at not Cc-ing THP developers in the previous revision, since it
was modifying THP source code.  Since this version is modifying only DAMON
source code, you don't really need to Cc more than DAMON developers.  Asking
wider inputs is good practice.  And it worked very well.  We got great inputs
from Asier, David and Zi.  But some people don't really like having too much
mails in their inbox.  My personal rule of thumb is just running
get_maintainer.pl via 'hkml patch format' [1].  You must have your own rule,
though :)

The last sentence may better to go to changelog.  If you want to highlight, you
can put changelog at the top of the cover letter.

This is also not feasible to be the cover letter main content.

As I commented to the previous version [2], this sounds like you are saying two
very different things.  Monitoring quality degradation issue and better THP
handling of DAMOS.  This makes understanding the motivation of this series
difficult, as other people also pointed out.

Based on your replies to others, now I understand you are proposing DAMOS_SPLIT
as a way for improving the monitoring results.  I'm waiting for your more
clarification of the issue, to better assess if this makes sense or not, as I
commented on the reply to Zi's reply.

It is completely fine to keep having tests in progress.  But, please make the
story complete.  What damos_split.py and sangfor_exp.py do?  What the results
mean?  What the performance tests will do with what expectation?

You mentioned this series is for monitoring quality improvement.  If so,
shouldn't you just apply it to all THPs, regardless of the access pattern?  I'm
again being confused.  More clarification of the motivation would be useful.

Ditto.

I don't fully understand the question.  Could you please elaborate more?

You mentioned this work is for monitoring quality improvement.  Now you are
saying somewhat followup.  I'm again being confused.
