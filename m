I sent a new revision implementing these changes, but due to a rebase
mistake it was also sent as v8.

However, it still does not cover every case of non-uniform driver-backed
PMU availability. With ACPI, if a CPU is brought online whose MIDR was
not represented by any CPU online during PMU probing, the PMU code
cannot associate it with an existing arm_pmu or register a new one.
This can happen even when PMUVer is uniform across CPUs.

I therefore plan to take a simpler approach: when KVM cannot find a
registered pPMU for the vCPU's current CPU, emit a one-time warning and
set TAINT_CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC, matching the treatment of mismatched CPU
features.
