Christian,

Could you help me please understand how the next branch makes
its way to the kernel?

I see NixOS Offers the latest as of 7.1.

The topic for binfmt is named on 7.3.binfmt in vfs so my assumption is
that it's slated for 7.3.

So that means when Linux pulls for 7.3.rc1 I could start to test it on
NixOS? Maybe 3 more weeks?
