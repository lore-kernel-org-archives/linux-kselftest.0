Hi Michal,

Good to hear from you, and thanks for taking the time to go through this
in detail -- it's genuinely helpful.

Yeah, fair point -- I got a bit carried away enumerating errnos. I'll
keep just the functional checks (one trigger per fd, irq has no "some").

Noted, I'll loosen that up.

That's a much better idea, thanks -- I'll switch to CPU pressure (more
tasks than CPUs), which should make it deterministic and drop the SKIP,
and clears up only touching memory here. I'll also rework the harness so
the child enters the constrained cgroup rather than the parent, following
test_memcontrol.c's cg_run(), and cap memory.swap.max so the child can't
thrash and the parent's waitpid can't hang (the sashiko points there).

Good catch on the hardcoded 4096 -- I'll use sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE),
matching test_memcontrol.c, and see whether the page-touch helper is
worth sharing across the cgroup tests.

Makes sense -- I'll add the skip-guards (PSI disabled,
IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING) and fold irq into the per-resource loop, skipping
only "some".

On the sashiko follow-up: agreed on adding test_psi to .gitignore. The
buf flags are only reached on a cg_read() failure path, so harmless in
practice, but I'll zero-initialize the buffers to be clean.

I'll put together a v2 with all of the above. 

Thanks again!
