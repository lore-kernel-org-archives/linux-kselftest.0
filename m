They would also be bypassed by AT_EMPTY_PATH, so you don't even need
magic-links to cause the issue. This is why I considered doing it with
"struct path" and doing the blocking in *_permission() -- all of the
standard vfs operations already have .

Well, definitely not initially. You also don't really need to call it
RESTRICT_LOOKUP, blocking exec would be the "unixy" thing to do (and it
would be nice to have that to block fexecveat(2) too, but that is a
_VERY_ deep rabbithole).

There were quite a few other issues with it, but that is one of them.

Sorry, I probably should've couched my reply with a bit more caution --
I really appreciate the enthusiasm, but this is quite a hairy topic for
quite a number of reasons. It will involve touching everything
fd-related in the kernel, it touches on an already-rejected patchset,
and is a topic that can get very heated easily. I would not rate the
chance of getting something merged very highly, and I think there are
more fruitful things for you to tackle and get your hands dirty.

Honestly, I think most people will be more than happy with just getting
the O_EMPTYPATH part merged -- looking back, I really should've just
done that back in 2019. :/

It wasn't based on the magic-link mode, I added a capability set to
"struct path" and then went and adjusted all generic_permission()s to
take the new capability mask. For stuff that did file_permission() or
path_permission(), no code change was needed.

Unfortunately this ran into quite a few hairy issues that made it
basically unmergeable (bloating "struct path" is very bad as it is
embedded everywhere, the whole model is kind of questionable because it
makes "struct path" have state about the lookup that produced it, some
VFS APIs deal with inodes or dentries directly and thus would need more
tree-wide fixes, and most importantly it just felt really ugly).

The open_tree(2) / mount(MS_BIND) issue is particularly problematic --
ideally you would want to block a RW bind-mount for a read-only file,
but there isn't really an obvious mechanism for passing down those kinds
of restrictions. Actually, fsconfig() arguments like "upperdir" to
overlayfs (or even "source") are likely even worse -- now you need
per-filesystem-option handling.

I don't think these issues are insurmountable, it's just that the
problem is much harder than it looks at first glance and I would humbly
suggest that working on reviving a very dead patchset is not the best
use of your time. Container runtimes really *really* want this, which is
the main reason I keep coming back to it (and we ended up with it in the
UAPI group proposal page) but I think it's a very niche thing that has a
big risk of being a lot of wasted effort.
