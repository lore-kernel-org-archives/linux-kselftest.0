OK, will use:

#define rseq_smp_mb()   \
        __asm__ __volatile__ ("lock; addl $0,-128(%%rsp)" ::: "memory", "cc")

as done in tools/virtio/ringtest/main.h

I agree that section names don't need to be passed as arguments, since it
is not useful information to understand the flow of asm using those
macros. Will remove.

I don't want to hide anything within macros that would prevent someone
looking that the overall assembly to understand the flow.

So all labels and references to named input operands, are passed as
arguments to those macros.

See this as passing arguments to functions. It makes the overall
assembly using those macros easier to read.

Good point for the @section, will move it into the macro because it is not
useful to understand the flow.

Same for @sig. Will move into the macro, given that it's not useful to
understand the flow.

It's needed to hold the "teardown" code needed on error, for the
memcpy loops. You're right that I don't need it for all the other
cases, and I can directly jump to the cmpfail_label. Will do.

A compare-and-exchange will load the original value and return it.
With rseq, it appears that all we need is to compare a value, and
store the new value if the comparison succeeded. We seldom care
about returning the old value, so we might as well skip that load.
But then it's _not_ a cmpxchg, because it does not return the prior
value.

Good point, it removes @version, @flags, and the 2f-1f calculation from the
asm, which distract from the flow.

I'll add a comment if that's what you're pointing to.

Good point. It's a leftover from the prior iterations where I needed
to clear the rseq_cs field before exiting from the critical section.
Now that the kernel does it lazily, I don't need a "teardown" code
in those cases, and we can directly jump to the cmpfail label. Will
do.

Not quite. I'll add this comment:

No, given that it should only be touched by rseq or cpu_opv, which
don't allow concurrent accesses on the same per-cpu data.

Sure, I could do the load once, and compare against a register
instead. It's not needed for correctness, but seems cleaner
nevertheless. I'll need to use some other register than rax though,
because I don't want to clash with the RSEQ_INJECT_ASM() delay-injection
loops, which are using eax. Perhaps rbx then.

Yes, exactly! ;)

Well, what's the point in supporting only a subset of the x86 architecture ? ;)

Perhaps from a kernel code perspective it's not a correctness thing, but
this is a correctness issue for user-space code.

I have the following comments in liburcu near the x86-32 barriers:

 * We leave smp_rmb/smp_wmb as full barriers for processors that do not have
 * fence instructions.
 *
 * An empty cmm_smp_rmb() may not be enough on old PentiumPro multiprocessor
 * systems, due to an erratum.  The Linux kernel says that "Even distro
 * kernels should think twice before enabling this", but for now let's
 * be conservative and leave the full barrier on 32-bit processors.  Also,
 * IDT WinChip supports weak store ordering, and the kernel may enable it
 * under our feet; cmm_smp_wmb() ceases to be a nop for these processors.

So it looks like from a user-space perspective, having the smp_wmb() would
be a correctness issue for older kernels on IDT WinChip processors.

Now you could argue that the recent kernel that will implement the "rseq"
system call will _never_ enable this IDT WinChip OOSTORE stuff. So we would
end up relying on success of the rseq cpu_id field comparison to ensure
rseq is indeed available, and in those cases the OOSTORE-aware smp_wmb is not
needed on x86-32.

Am I understanding this correctly ?

In that case, we should really document that those rseq_smp_wmb() are only
valid when running on kernels that provide the rseq system call.

> Ideally we'd kill that PPRO_FENCE crap too.

AFAIU, this one is part of the PPRO architecture, not really enabled explicitly
by the kernel, right ? I'm not sure what we can do about this other than
politely asking everyone to throw away these old pieces of hardware... ;)

Thanks for the review!
