I think this is my concern; committing to a stable interface that
we'll have to maintain forever.
It's a narrow use case that can be better served by dedicated kfuncs
and rolling your own solution.
There will be no end to the number of iterators if we keep making one
for every linked list in the kernel.

It would be different if the synchronization scheme for the
wakeup_sources list was really complicated and hard to express inline
in the verifier, but that is not the case.

I would agree if this was a one-to-one conversion, where you just
replace the directory for look up.
But you'll be reading from one file vs several, so it's already a
non-trivial change in the consumer.
At that point, the conversion burden doesn't have the same weight in
deciding whether to stick with textual representation.

It was just an illustration to identify what guarantees the verifier
would need to enforce.
The most we need to do is just ensure SRCU indices are passed back
during unlock, in whatever order.
Critical section will be using bpf_core_cast() anyway to do safe
walking of the list.
With the KF_ACQUIRE/KF_RELEASE kfuncs you will still have a continuous
locking segment.
Just enclose your list walking loop between lock() and unlock().

I don't understand the security concern. All of this happens inside
the BPF program.
If you're writing these addresses to user space and leaking them, it's your=
 bug.
You can do that with iterators too. You have all the raw addresses
available to you.

I'm sure you can replicate it with the approach described above.
It might even be faster than parsing text from the file.

And you can do that regardless of the type of solution chosen above.
