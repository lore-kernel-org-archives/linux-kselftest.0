I didn't follow what you mean, the removal from the waitqueue happens in
free_poll_entry() called from poll_freewait() which happens from
do_sys_poll() which is before the syscall returns to user mode. Could you
explain more?

Here also I didn't follow what you mean. If exit_code is read as 0 in
pidfd_poll(), then in do_poll() the count will be 0 and it will block in
poll_schedule_timeout(). Right? But above you're saying it wont block.
Also if you could show a timing diagram of this different race you're talking
about, that will make things clear. It is a bit hard for me to picture
otherwise.

Also, I will use task_pid() for getting the pid from the task, as you suggest
in the other thread.

thanks,
