You can merge unfaulted ranges is the thing here.

But anyway I actually wonder whether this whole branch shouldn't be:

	if (!vma->anon_vma) {
		...
	}

Because that way we keep anon_pgoff updated even for MAP_SHARED mappings. This
isn't necessary and doesn't impact anything _except_ print_bad_page_map which
outputs both pgoffs.

But it'd be consistent, avoid any confusion about gating on VMA_SHARED, and
simplify the code :)

A MAP_SHARED mapping of a read-only file becomes a MAP_PRIVATE !VMA_MAYWRITE_BIT
mapping and must adhere to the same contract.

Also mmap hooks can clear the VMA_MAYWRITE_BIT.

However:

- If you're a driver clearing VMA_MAYWRITE_BIT you should only be doing this for
  'special' mappings anyway (I have a series I've not sent yet that establishes
  this as an invariant also) - and these are not mergeable anyway.

- If you're a !VMA_MAYWRITE_BIT MAP_PRIVATE-file backed mappings you never set
  vma->anon_vma and always update anon pgoff so you always have alignment for
  purposes of merge.

So I think also we can then change needs_adjacent_anon_pgoff() to:

static bool needs_adjacent_anon_pgoff(const struct vma_merge_struct *vmg)
{
	return vmg->file && is_cow_mapping(...);
}

[I have to create a vma_flags_t variant of is_cow_mapping()]

With those two changes we gate on VMA_SHARED_BIT nowhere :)

For pure anon yeah, see above for the MAP_SHARED->MAP_PRIVATE-file backed weird
case.

(It's funny to me that if you want a truly read-only MAP_PRIVATE file-backed
mapping (no idea why you would but anyway) you have to MAP_SHARED, but an
actually MAP_PRIVATE file-backed mapping of a read-only file is writable [which
makes sense obviously] :)
