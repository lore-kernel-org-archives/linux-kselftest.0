Subject: [PATCH v11 06/14] fs, arm64: untag user pointers in copy_mount_options
In-Reply-To: <cover.1552679409.git.andreyknvl@google.com>

This patch is a part of a series that extends arm64 kernel ABI to allow to
pass tagged user pointers (with the top byte set to something else other
than 0x00) as syscall arguments.

In copy_mount_options a user address is being subtracted from TASK_SIZE.
If the address is lower than TASK_SIZE, the size is calculated to not
allow the exact_copy_from_user() call to cross TASK_SIZE boundary.
However if the address is tagged, then the size will be calculated
incorrectly.

Untag the address before subtracting.
