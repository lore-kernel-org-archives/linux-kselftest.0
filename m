Yes, I was also confused by this. But I always follow the "when-in-rome"
rule. My understanding is the same as yours is that __u8 should be used
for userspace compatibility which doesn't apply here. If there is
consensus on this being wrong, I'd be happy to write a cleanup patch
that fixes it separate from this series.

Fixed for when I send v2.
