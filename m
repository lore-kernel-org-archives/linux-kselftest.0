Sure, returning the bottom device index with the VLAN tag makes sense,
and that's basically what this series does (but bails out on stacked
VLANs). However, that's not what the helper does today, which is why the
flag is there, to opt-in to the new behaviour. I don't think we can just
change the ifindex without breaking existing applications (as noted
up-thread).

Agreed, I don't think we can handle stacked devices in this helper. But
we could split it out into a new one. Something like:

struct lower_device_info {
	enum device_type type;
	struct {
		__be16	h_vlan_proto;
		__be16	h_vlan_TCI;
	} vlan;
        /* add other types here */
};

int xdp_get_lower_device(int ifindex, struct lower_device_info *info);

called like:

int xdp_program(struct xdp_md *ctx)
{
        struct lower_device_info dev_info =3D {};
	int ifindex, ret;

        ifindex =3D find_destination(ctx); /* does fib lookup, or something=
 else */

        while ((ret =3D xdp_get_lower_device_info(ifindex, &dev_info)) > 0)=
 {
        	if (dev_info.type =3D=3D VLAN) {
                      	push_vlan_tag(ctx, &dev_info.vlan);
                        ifindex =3D ret;
                } else {
                	return XDP_PASS; /* we only handle VLAN devices */
                }
        }

        return bpf_redirect(ifindex, 0);
}


With a helper like this, we obviously don't strictly speaking need to
change the fib lookup helper at all. However, for the single-tagged VLAN
case, I think supporting it directly in the fib lookup could still have
value, as an optimisation: it saves an extra call for resolving the
ifindex, and the fields are already there. So I think my preference
would be to merge this series as-is, and then follow up with a new kfunc
to handle the stacked case. But we could also just drop this series and
go straight to the new kfunc.

WDYT?
