Right. I think landing shared guest_memfd is the first step. It is
simple enough and doesn't need to preserve the more complicated
architecture specific things like secure EPT, etc. The CoCo support
can build on top of this.

There is work underway already for an RFC of TDX live update, but Tarun
knows the details better than me so I'll let him fill in the details for
the next version of this series.

Sure, that sounds good to me.

Yep, as long as we agree among ourselves I don't think the red tape
around which entry has higher priority matters much.

I think there is a slight difference between KVM's save/resture uAPI and
live update's ABI. With KVM's uAPI, you need to maintain strict
backwards compatibility because userspace reads what you output. So if
you change the layout, userspace will interpret it wrong and might
break.

With live update, the ABI never gets to userspace. It is used to talk
between kernels directly. So if you do break that, your userspace keeps
working fine, you just might not be able to live update to the
incompatible kernel.

So with live update, we don't need to keep backwards compatibility in
the ABI forever. Of course, it is good to minimize changes, but we have
more freedom to change it.

The current idea is we change the ABI whenever needed. This is because
live update is still in development so we are likely to see a lot more
changes before we settle down into something that mostly works. At some
point, we want to start being more strict between incompatible ABI
changes. The current idea is that we would like to keep backwards
compatibility across LTS kernels. But none of that is set in stone yet.

That's why I would like to have an explicit ACK from the live update
group for ABI changes. I would like to enforce these compatibility
windows.

That's a bug, and should be fixed.

I am talking here about intentional ABI changes. As I mentioned above we
_can_ change the ABI, we just need to be careful about it.

Outside of enforcing the ABI compatibility windows, I think this makes
sense.

In principle at least, though from my experience the maintainer appetite
to care about live update varies. The feeling I've got from MM for
example is more along the lines of "you break it, you buy it". Which is
also a valid model IMO. The person who wrote the live update code for a
subsystem is well equipped to understand these nuances.

As I wrote above, the compatibility model for live update allows
breaking ABI with version bumps. Userspace keeps working fine, it only
restricts the set of kernels that you can go to. So the "we'll deal with
it later" is not as harmful because our choices here are not permanent.

Also, there is work underway to allow transitions between versions [0].

But still, I am not opposed to a more flexible guest_memfd ABI. I think
we can reserve some space for feature flags to let us add things in the
future.
