The patches in this series look fine but my concern is that they are not
sufficient and we don't have (yet?) a way to identify where such
annotations are required. You even say in patch 6 that this is "some
initial work for supporting non-zero address tags passed to the kernel".
Unfortunately, merging (or relaxing) an ABI without a clear picture is
not really feasible.

While I support this work, as a maintainer I'd like to understand
whether we'd be in a continuous chase of ABI breaks with every kernel
release or we have a better way to identify potential issues. Is there
any way to statically analyse conversions from __user ptr to long for
example? Or, could we get the compiler to do this for us?

Thanks.
