Hey I feel the question wasn't answered completely :)

Here is the reason for the asymmetric save restore (besides the tcr2
part):

GCSCR
 If guest E2H == 1:
 - L1 accesses to GCSCR_EL2 and GCSCR_EL1 have the same intent -> they
   both mean access the vCPU GCSCR_EL2.
 - L1 access to GCSCR_EL2 (e.g. msr GCSCR_EL2, x0) traps, KVM updates
   both the in-memory vCPU GCSCR_EL2, and the hardware GCSCR_EL1 for the
   the guest. In-memory copy stays up to date.
 - L1 access to GCSCR_EL1 does not trap -> in-memory vCPU GCSCR_EL2
   becomes stale if it's a write.
 - From above, must save on exit.

 If guest E2H == 0:
 - Only L1 accesses to GCSCR_EL2 mean access the vCPU GCSCR_EL2.
 - L1 accesses to GCSCR_EL2 always traps.
 - In-memory vCPU GCSCR_EL2 always stay up to date.
 - From above, no need to save on exit.

GCSPR
 - Regardless of the guest E2H value, hardware could write to the
   hardware GCSPR_EL1, making the in-memory vCPU GCSPR_EL2 stale.
 - From above, must save on exit.

Restore is trivial, vCPU GCSCR_EL2/GCSPR_EL2 must be written to the
hardware EL1 registers because someone else could be using it.

Quite a few other registers are saved only if guest E2H == 1 because of
the same reason.
