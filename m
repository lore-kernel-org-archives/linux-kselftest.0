On arm64 the TCR_EL1.TBI0 bit has been always enabled hence
the userspace (EL0) is allowed to set a non-zero value in the
top byte but the resulting pointers are not allowed at the
user-kernel syscall ABI boundary.

With the relaxed ABI proposed in this set, it is now possible to pass
tagged pointers to the syscalls, when these pointers are in memory
ranges obtained by an anonymous (MAP_ANONYMOUS) mmap() or sbrk().

Relax the requirements described in tagged-pointers.txt to be compliant
with the behaviours guaranteed by the ABI deriving from the introduction
of the ARM64_AT_FLAGS_SYSCALL_TBI flag.
